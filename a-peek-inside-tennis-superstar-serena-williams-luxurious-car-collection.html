In addition, she was the highest-paid female athlete for the majority of those 20 years. As one of the wealthiest female athletes, she spent a considerable sum on luxury and performance-oriented automobiles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her collection includes a Bentley, an Aston Martin, and a Mini, indicating a preference for British automobiles. Now that Serena Williams has <a href=#>announced her retirement from tennis</a>, she has a great deal of time to enjoy her delicious rides and even add to her car collection. Let’s take a peek inside tennis superstar Serena Williams’ luxurious car collection.</p><h2 id=lincoln-navigator>Lincoln Navigator</h2><p>In 2018, she became the brand ambassador for Lincoln, and the tennis star has been spotted driving this premium SUV. Williams's very first automobile was the Navigator, so associating herself with it was a nostalgic experience. After eight years of ownership, Williams gifted the car to her niece with the affectionate moniker "Ginger" she had given the vehicle. The Grand Slam champion is now back in command of her cherished Lincoln, albeit with an updated model.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bentley-continental-gt>Bentley Continental GT</h2><p>Bentley Continental GT is one of the <a href=#>most popular cars among celebrities</a>. It is equipped with a 4.0-liter Twin-Turbocharged V8 engine that delivers 543 horsepower and 770 Nm of torque. This ultimate machine can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in just 4.3 seconds and has a top speed of 192 miles per hour. costing $220,000. Continental GT is the greatest coupe ever with its ultra-luxurious interior and astoundingly potent engine. This is one of Serena Williams' finest vehicles.</p><h2 id=mercedes-benz-g63-amg>Mercedes-Benz G63 AMG</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Williams also drives a Mercedes-Benz G63 AMG with a 4.0-liter Bi-Turbocharge V8 engine that produces 577hp and 760 Nm of torque, can accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 5.6 seconds, and has a top speed of 130 miles per hour. Due to its classic boxy design, there is some cabin noise at triple-digit speeds and a slight body roll in corners. This is also one of the <a href=#>most eccentric cars</a> in Serena Williams' collection.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Peek Inside Dua Lipa's Insane Car Collection</a></span></p><h2 id=aston-martin-vanquish>Aston Martin Vanquish</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being a world-famous superstar athlete has its own advantages. Prior to being the brand ambassador for Lincoln, Williams represented Aston Martin. Being the face of such a well-known premium sports vehicle company comes with rewards most gearheads can only imagine, such as receiving a free Aston Martin. This supercar boasts a 5.9L V12 engine that develops 565hp and 620 Nm of torque and can go from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds and reach a top speed of 201 mph. And it costs a staggering $316,000!</p><h2 id=mini-cooper-s>Mini Cooper S</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Mini Cooper</a> is the company's bread and butter due to its amazing tiny body style, notable precise handling, and fun-to-drive experience, all of which are catered to by a vast array of modification possibilities.

Similarly, the German automaker BMW has established the BMW 7 Series as the benchmark for ultra-luxury, leisurely sedans with its BMW 7 Series. And <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the new 2022 BMW X7</a> exemplifies this style-meets-luxury impression in the eyes of purchasers with its opulent interiors and potent turbocharged engine, all at an affordable price when compared to Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, and Bentley.
