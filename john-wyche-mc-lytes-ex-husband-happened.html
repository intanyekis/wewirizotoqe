Despite the fact that details regarding his life and family background are lacking at the time of writing, his father’s Facebook profile only listed his two siblings, a brother, and a sister.</p><p>According to multiple trustworthy sources, Wyche is a United States Marine Corps veteran, although there is no information on when he served or for how long. Furthermore, it was stated that he is an entrepreneur, however, it is unknown what type of business he operates or owns.</p><p>MC Lyte, on the other hand, was born in New York City on October 11, 1970. She grew up in Brooklyn’s East Flatbush neighborhood.</p><p>Lyte began rapping at the age of 12 and recorded her first single when she was 14.

They got engaged in May 2017 and married three months later in Montego Bay, Jamaica. Both expressed happiness for finding love in each other’s arms.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Lyte sought divorce from Wyche</a> three years after the wedding. The reason for the split has been given as irreconcilable differences.</p><p>Her ex-husband’s divorce is one of those famous marriages that lasted fewer than five years. Such marriages include <a href=# rel=noopener>Grace Harry</a> and Usher, Johnny Deep, and <a href=# rel=noopener>Amber Heard</a>,&nbsp;and Chris Martin and <a href=# rel=noopener>Gwyneth Paltrow</a>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Wyche_And_Lytes_Divorce_Was_Finalized_In_2023></span><b>Wyche And Lyte’s Divorce Was Finalized In 2023</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>John Wyche and MC Lyte’s divorce was finalized in January 2023. This comes just three years after Lyte filed for divorce owing to irreconcilable differences in 2020, as previously stated.</p><p>The divorce took three years to finalize, and as a result, the media continued to spread stories that Lyte’s ex-husband was trying to take a cut of her fortune. However, the rapper and entrepreneur cleared the air in a January 2023 Instagram post, accusing the media of exploiting her divorce for click baits and views. She insisted that her ex-husband made no attempt to seize her assets before, during, or after their marriage.</p><p>She said the divorce was delayed because her ex-husband was trying to preserve their marriage.</p><p>Wyche’s ex-wife took advantage of the situation to advise individuals contemplating marriage to obtain a prenuptial agreement in order to avoid conflict in the event of divorce. She also advised people to protect their entire properties through good insurance, and financial, and estate planning.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Lyte is keeping her whole assets</a>, including her music catalog. This is feasible since she and her ex-husband signed a prenuptial agreement prior to their August 2017 wedding.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiipaCyo8HGrGWcp51kt7C0zWauspuYmnqur4ylsK2do2KyuXnHrqqbmZ6Zeqmtz6mcp52UZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jay-z-beyonce-and-9-other-celeb-couples-who-had-small-private-weddings.html><span>←</span><span>Jay Z &amp;amp; Beyonc And 9 Other Celeb Couples Who Had Small, Private Weddings</span></a>
