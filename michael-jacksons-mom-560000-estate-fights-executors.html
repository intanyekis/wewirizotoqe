He died at the age of 50 at his home in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, California. The cause of death was acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication, and his death was ruled a homicide. Dr. Conrad Murray, Michael Jackson's personal physician, was later convicted of involuntary manslaughter for administering the drugs that led to Jackson's death.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Jackson left his estate to his three children - Prince, Paris, and Blanket - he did set up a separate trust named The Katherine Jackson Trust to care for his mother, Katherine, throughout her life.</p><p>John Branca and John McClain were appointed executors of Michael's estate (and thus the money set aside for Katherine) and claim to have made hundreds of millions for Jackson’s legacy through various deals. Last year, they sought court approval for a confidential, reportedly lucrative deal, which Katherine opposed in a heavily redacted response. While the court eventually dismissed her objections, Katherine is continuing to appeal the decision. The $560,000 she wants from Michael’s estate is to cover legal expenses related to fighting the executors. Her appeal as well as the new motion remain ongoing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqGTna6muIyjmJyjo6S7tHnMqKRmbWZlfXF8jJ6qrZmkmnqntcahq6xlla2ypMHTqKmsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marc-anthony-grow-long-shampoo-conditioner-duo.html><span>←</span><span>Marc Anthony Shampoo and Conditioner Duo Can Help Hair Grow</span></a>
