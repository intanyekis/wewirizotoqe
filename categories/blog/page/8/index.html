Another day’s at end
Mama says she’s tired again
No one can even begin to tell her
I hardly know what to say

She always loved to swim away
Maybe she’ll find an island
With a shaded tree
Just like the one in our backyard</article><article class=post-entry><h2>In 2012 Gary Busey Had Negative $500,00 To His Name, Here's How Much He Has Today</h2><time>Aug 29, 2024</time>
