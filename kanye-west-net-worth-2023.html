Even though the evidence was there for this, he still took issue with it, and <a href=#>Kanye even continuously emailed Forbes over them supposedly 'refusing' to list him as a billionaire</a>.</p><p>The Adidas deal accounted for $1.5 billion of his initial net worth, so when this and various other deals fell through due to his antisemitic comments, which is what led to a loss of earnings, Kanye apparently wasn't happy that he was no longer classed as a billionaire.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even when they did list him as a billionaire in 2020, he pushed back on how much Forbes listed him as being worth.
