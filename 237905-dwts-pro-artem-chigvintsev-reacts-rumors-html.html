As for Artem, he is engaged to former pro wrestler Nikki Bella and the two have just welcomed their first child, Matteo in July 2020.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>THE RUMORS</strong></p><p class=Fg><a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.etonline.com/artem-chigvintsev-says-carrie-ann-inabas-dwts-criticism-of-kaitlyn-bristowe-feels-personal>Outraged fans</a> immediately put two and two together and added up to five: Jealousy. They believed Carrie Ann was persecuting Artem because he was now happy in a new relationship, with a child.</p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>Arem and Kaitlyn were awarded a perfect score by every "DWTS" judge -- and yes, that included Carrie Ann</strong></h3><p class=Fg>Artem himself is the first to dismiss the entire notion that Carrie Ann is being vindictive as completely ridiculous, and that her criticism had nothing do with their past, and everything to do with his and "Bachelorette" alum Kaitly's future on "DWTS." He said <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j11zc85AeLw">frankly</a>:</p><p class=Fg>"I think she just really was harsh in the sense that she saw so much more potential than what we’ve been delivering the past two weeks and she finally got things that she’s been wanting to see.”</p><p class=Fg>Carrie Ann was stunned and amused by the supposition that she was jealous of Artem. She pointed out that she is friendly with the couple and has even had Nikki Bella as a guest on the show she co-hosts, "The Talk." She <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j11zc85AeLw">said</a> laughing:</p><p class=Fg>“This is what I love about "The Bachelor" fans and "Bachelorette" fans. They can create a story around it. And it’s weird because I totally understood what they were doing."</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>STANDING OVATION</strong></p><p class=Fg>The accusers were befuddled on November 9, 2020, when Arem and Kaitlyn were <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.tvinsider.com/956299/dwts-abc-carrie-ann-inaba-kaitlyn-artem-perfect-score-hug-covid/ ;">awarded a perfect score </a>by every "DWTS" judge -- and yes, that included Carrie Ann -- for their dazzling tango to the sound of Britney Spears' "Toxic."</p><p class=Fg>Carrie Ann gave the dancing duo a standing ovation, and Artem ran over to give her a heartfelt hug. It turns out that the exacting judge was right, Artem and Kaitlyn could do more, and they delivered perfection.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtqcHFganqlw9OsZKmqn2Kus8DEpmScoJmcw6q606ycr2Wimq6kwNJmqa6ln6fAb7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./destroy-lonely-wolf-meme-explained-twitter-reaction-on-his-dreadlocks-and-face.html><span>←</span><span>Destroy Lonely Wolf Meme Explained: Twitter Reaction On His Dreadlocks And Face</span></a>
