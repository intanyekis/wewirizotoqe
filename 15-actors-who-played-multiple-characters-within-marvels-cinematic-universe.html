But, they also use things like sports and video games to cure their boredom, and in the past, comic books were another popular method. Comic books have been around for more than half a century, and although people today tend to read A LOT less physical copies, the comic book industry as a whole is still doing pretty well. People have gravitated to comic books for so long because they give us selfless heroes who will do whatever it takes to uphold justice and to save as many innocents as possible. And in most cases, these heroes and their villains, are pretty relatable, despite the fact that most of these characters have some kind of superpower.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Entire generations have grown up with comic books, and thanks to advancements in special effects, it was really only a matter of time before Hollywood decided to adapt these comic books for the big screen. Marvel and DC are the two biggest comic book publishers in the world, and as of right now, there are three different cinematic universes based on their respective catalog of characters. And so far, Marvel's Cinematic Universe is, without a doubt, the superior product. The MCU currently consists of 17 movies and 9 shows, and since the Universe began a decade ago, dozens of actors have been cast. In this kind of situation, an actor needs to play just one character because if they portray another one in the same Universe, viewers might get confused. However, with a Universe as big as Marvel's, these things sometimes happen, and this article will focus on 15 actors who did play multiple MCU characters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sean-gunn><strong>Sean Gunn</strong></h2><p>2014 saw the release of&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy, a movie that focused around a team of heroes that only real hardcore comic book fans knew about, which is why many thought that Marvel was taking a fairly big risk with the movie. That risk turned out to be a very good call as the movie became a massive hit, and its sequel managed to perform even better at the box office. James Gunn wrote and directed both films, which included the interstellar crime syndicate known as The Ravagers, the group that Star Lord spent most of his life with. There are many Ravagers seen in the films, including Kraglin, who serves as Yondu's first mate. He is played by Gunn's brother, Sean, who also plays Rocket Raccoon. Yes, Bradley Cooper voices the hilarious raccoon, but Sean acts as the on-set stand-in in order to give the other actors someone real to interact with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alfre-woodward><strong>Alfre Woodward</strong></h2><p>Marvel made an outstanding amount of money during the first phase of its cinematic universe, so it was not even remotely surprising that Disney wanted to expand the universe to television. ABC was once home to two such shows, but it is thanks to Disney's deal with Netflix that we have been given shows like&nbsp;Luke Cage, which revolve around comic book heroes and which are generally well-received by critics and viewers.&nbsp;Luke Cage&nbsp;featured several villains, including Mariah Dillard, who started out as a politician but ended up becoming the new crime lord of Harlem, and she is portrayed by actress Alfre Woodward.&nbsp; Luke Cage&nbsp;premiered in 2016, the same year that saw the release of&nbsp;Captain America: Civil War, and Woodward appeared in it as Miriam Sharpe, who confronted Tony Stark and blamed him for her son's death, an act that has major implications in the movie going forward.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=enver-gjokaj><strong>Enver Gjokaj</strong></h2><p>There will soon be 25 movies in the MCU, and in all likelihood, all of the upcoming films will either be decent or great, which has pretty much been the case for most of Marvel's movies. There are some exceptions, though, as&nbsp;The Avengers&nbsp;was fantastic, and it is still considered to be the best Marvel movie, and with good reason because it was a perfect culmination of all the movies that make up the first phase. In&nbsp;The Avengers, New York gets attacked by aliens, and during the battle, the police are tasked with trying to get civilians to safety, and one of those cops is played by&nbsp;Enver Gjokaj, an actor who has appeared in several TV shows. One of those shows was Marvel's&nbsp;Agent Carter,&nbsp;and in it, Gjokaj played Agent Daniel Sousa, who worked alongside him and had feelings for Peggy Carter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matt-gerald><strong>Matt Gerald</strong></h2><p>Matt Gerald is an actor and screenwriter who has appeared in various movies, including&nbsp; G.I. Joe: Retaliation,&nbsp;<i>Avatar</i>, as well as two of its upcoming sequels, and the upcoming&nbsp; Rampage&nbsp;film featuring The Rock. Gerald joined the MCU in 2014, where he played White Power Dave in the Marvel One-Shot: All Hail the King.&nbsp;In it, he threatens Trevor Slattery, the man who impersonated The Mandarin in&nbsp;Iron Man 3. Considering that the one-shot was basically a very short film, Gerald had very few lines, something that changed in 2015 when he landed a recurring role on&nbsp;Daredevil.&nbsp;In the Netflix series, Gerald plays Melvin Potter, a mentally-impaired individual who is in fact incredibly smart, and after being forced by Kingpin to make suits for criminals, he willingly creates daredevil's suit before "retiring" from the suit-making business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rob-zombie><strong>Rob Zombie</strong></h2><p>In the entertainment industry, it is somewhat common now to see musicians, models, and athletes venture into the world of television and cinema, and one of the people who has done this transition really well is Rob Zombie. For those who have never listened to him, Zombie is the founder of the heavy metal band White Zombie, but he is also known for being a screenwriter and director, and the movies he has made are known for being pretty violent and graphic. He has also had some minor acting jobs, which includes two appearances in the MCU, credits that he got, thanks to his longtime friend, James Gunn, who gave him a role in both&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy&nbsp;movies. In the first movie, he portrayed a navigator for the aforementioned Ravagers, and in the sequel, he got the chance to play a completely different Ravager.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=spencer-garrett><strong>Spencer Garrett</strong></h2><p>When it comes down to it, we have both Robert Downey Jr. and&nbsp;Iron Man to thank for the existence of the&nbsp;Marvel Cinematic Universe because if the first movie had failed, there might not be a third&nbsp;Avengers&nbsp;movie coming out this year. Since the release of the first movie, Iron Man has had two sequels, and the general consensus is that&nbsp;Iron Man 3&nbsp;is the worst of the three, mainly because it had a weak story and villain. In it, Tony Stark finds himself at a bar in the town of Rose Hill and while there, he gets attacked. But, before he gets attacked, the local sheriff tries to step in and gets killed for it. The sheriff was played by actor Spencer Garrett, but he is also credited for playing the newsreel announcer in&nbsp;Captain America: The First Avenger,&nbsp;which took place over 70 years earlier.</p><h2 id=damion-poitier><strong>Damion Poitier</strong></h2><p>When you go to see a Marvel movie, you know that you are going to see more than one action scene, and in order to film those scenes, you need capable stuntmen and women. Damien Poitier is one of these stuntmen, and he is so good at his craft that he has appeared in a fairly lengthy list of films and shows, where he usually plays a thug/bad guy. But, he has also had some actual roles where we get to see him speak. Other than being a stuntman in both&nbsp;Thor: The Dark World&nbsp;and&nbsp;Civil War, he also played one of the mercenaries working alongside the villain Crossbones at the beginning of&nbsp;Civil War, but that was not his biggest credited role in the MCU. We know that Josh Brolin plays Thanos, the big bad of the MCU, but when we first see Thanos in the post-credit scene of&nbsp;The Avengers, he is being played by Poitier.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=martin-starr><strong>Martin Starr</strong></h2><p>Mark Ruffalo has done a great job as Bruce Banner and The Hulk, and although he made his first appearance in 2012 with&nbsp;The Avengers,&nbsp;his character has actually been a part of the MCU since 2008. There was once a debate over whether or not&nbsp;The Incredible Hulk&nbsp; was part of the universe, seeing as different actors portrayed Banner/Hulk. But, that debate has since been settled&nbsp;by Marvel, which means that Martin Starr has indeed appeared in the universe as different characters. In 2008, he played Amadeus Cho, a computer nerd who gives Banner access to Culver University in exchange for some pizza, but he also appeared in last summer's&nbsp;Spider-Man: Homecoming.&nbsp;In&nbsp;Spider-Man, he plays Roger Harrington, a science teacher who also served as the head of Peter Parker's Academic Decathlon Team.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=clancy-brown><strong>Clancy Brown</strong></h2><p>It is no surprise that Marvel has had a hard time with its villains, but that is mainly the fault of the writers because in most cases, the villains are very well-cast and get portrayed by some pretty good actors. Clancy Brown may not be a household name, but he has been acting for 35 years, and he is one of those guys who has a voice that is easily recognizable, thanks to how deep it is. Brown first appeared in the MCU in the second season of&nbsp; Daredevil&nbsp;as Colonel Ray Schoonover, a high-ranking military official who also happened to be a drug lord known as The Blacksmith; and he reprises this role in the first season of&nbsp;The Punisher.&nbsp;Last November, Marvel used his voice acting talents for Surtur, the fire demon that goes on to destroy Asgard in&nbsp;Thor: Ragnarok.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tony-curran><strong>Tony Curran</strong></h2><p>Thor is a very powerful hero in the comics, and they have successfully shown that power in every movie that he has appeared in, including his three solo films, films that managed to do really well despite the fact that the first two&nbsp;Thor&nbsp;movies were pretty lackluster. In&nbsp;Thor: The Dark World,&nbsp;we spend a lot more time in Asgard, and we get to see Thor's home get invaded by the Dark Elves, beings who were previously defeated by Thor's grandfather, and we get to see this victory in a flashback scene at the start of the movie. Bor is his grandfather's name, and he is played by actor Tony Curran, who has appeared in things like&nbsp;Underworld: Evolution&nbsp;and&nbsp;Doctor Who.&nbsp;He also appeared in the second season of&nbsp;Daredevil,&nbsp;where he played&nbsp;Finn Cooley, an Irish gangster who gets killed by The Punisher.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kenneth-choi><strong>Kenneth Choi</strong></h2><p>Many of you likely do not recognize the name Kenneth Choi, but you have definitely seen him, as he has appeared in over two dozen movies and shows, including&nbsp;Sons of Anarchy&nbsp; and&nbsp;The Wolf of Wall Street.&nbsp;As far as the MCU is concerned, we first see Choi in 2011 in&nbsp; Captain America: The First Avenger,&nbsp;where he played Jim Morita, the communications officer for The Howling Commandos, an elite combat unit for the Allies in WWII, a role that he reprises in an episode of&nbsp;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&nbsp;His next appearance came last summer in&nbsp;Spider-Man: Homecoming, where he played Principal Morita. It is true that both characters share the same last name, and there is a good reason for that as both characters are, in fact, related to each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id=laura-haddock><strong>Laura Haddock</strong></h2><p>It is true that&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy&nbsp;and its sequel told different stories, but there were still connections between both films, such as the team's relationship with both Thanos and the Ravagers. While the first movie introduced all of the Guardians, the sequel focused more on Star Lord and his family, including his mother, who died from cancer at the beginning of the first movie. Laura Haddock is the actress who played Meredith Quill, and she did an amazing job, especially in her first scene in the hospital bed, which is probably why she was brought back in the sequel with more screen time. The first&nbsp;Guardians&nbsp;came out in 2014, but Haddock first appeared in the MCU in 2011 with the first&nbsp;Captain America&nbsp;movie, where she played a young woman trying to get an autograph from Steve Rogers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nathan-fillion><strong>Nathan Fillion</strong></h2><p>Nathan Fillion is adored within the geek community, mainly thanks to his performances in the shows&nbsp;Firefly&nbsp;and Castle,&nbsp;but he has also appeared in the&nbsp;Halo and&nbsp;Destiny&nbsp;video game franchises while also lending his voice to DC, where he played Hal Jordan, otherwise known as Green Lantern, in multiple animated films. Fillion loves the Marvel movies, and he is friends with James Gunn, which is how he found himself playing a different character in the first and second&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy.&nbsp;In the first movie, he voiced the monstrous inmate who threatens Star Lord in prison, but then Groot and Rocket make an example of him. In the sequel, he plays actor Simon Williams, otherwise known as Wonder Man (another Avenger), and even though his scene was cut from the movie, James Gunn has said that this scene is still considered to be canonical.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jonathan-lipow><strong>Jonathan Lipow</strong></h2><p>Anyone who has watched a Marvel movie knows that every single MCU entry comes with a boatload of CGI, which is something to be expected seeing as there are too many characters that cannot come to life any other way. Even if these characters are not real, they still need to have voices in order to give make them seem realistic, which is where real people come in. Jonathan Lipow has appeared in movies such as The Vampire's Assistant, The Spiderwick Chronicles, and Seed of Chucky, but he is mostly known for voice acting in video games. In the first Guardians of the Galaxy, Lipow voiced the Sakaarans, the insectoid soldiers helping Ronan the Accuser, a role that is a tad miniscule, but he has voiced two very large and recognizable characters as well. In The Incredible Hulk, not only does he voice the big green guy himself, but he also voices Abomination, Hulk's enemy in the movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=benedict-cumberbatch><strong>Benedict Cumberbatch</strong></h2><p>There were those who thought that Marvel was taking a big risk with&nbsp;Doctor Strange, as the character would mean introducing the concept of real magic into a universe that was already pretty grounded in terms of scientific reasoning. The movie performed very well though, and a big reason for its success was the cast, which included Benedict Cumberbatch playing the main character. The Oscar-nominated actor is essentially the spitting image of the Sorcerer Supreme, which means that Marvel yet again nailed the casting of one of their heroes. However, what many people do not know is that Cumberbatch played double duty in the movie. Dormammu is an ancient being who serves as Doctor Strange's perennial villain, and in the movie, Cumberbatch provided the motion capture for him, which means that he not only portrayed the main hero in the movie, but the main villain as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYWp6oq%2FTqKmsZaedvG68y5qwnpxdosKtwMipo55lk52us63CrZyrq12strW0yKdkppmiq7Ktv4ycoKednZbBqq%2BMrqWirpWnwKZ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-hukilau-song-mel-peterson.html><span>←</span><span>The Hukilau Song - Mel Peterson</span></a>
