Am I ever going to watch that episode again? No, definitely not,” Kaity said. “But you know what? Zach and I have amazing communication. We pride ourselves on that. We just have phenomenal communication and loyalty to each other, and we came out stronger, and that is all I could have ever wanted in that situation.”</p><p>Kaity previously made her support for Gabi clear, taking to Instagram after the March 20 episode to support her fellow finalist.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Beyond grateful for this incredible [woman] and our friendship,” Kaity wrote. “Thank you for always lighting up a room with your beautiful, [quirky] personality! You exude the best energy that is so contagious to be around! Thank you for always being YOU! Truly, one of the most beautiful humans inside and out.
