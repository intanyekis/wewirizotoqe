In August, it was revealed the <a href=#>singer had given out $55 million bonuses</a> to staff members as she was about to close the U.S. leg of her Eras tour, which has broken records. So far, it’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated to be on track to make $5.7 billion</a>, reportedly making it the highest grossing tour ever (and booting multiple countries’ economies).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The bonuses for truck drivers alone were $5 million, as each received $100,000 individually.</p><p>In October, it was reported Taylor was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">officially a billionaire following the re-recording</a> of album 1989, released nearly a decade ago. Her net wroth is now estimated to be $1.1 billion. She’s making <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$13 million per Eras tour stop</a>, not to mention profits from the success of the accompanying movie, meaning her net worth will likely continue to skyrocket in the new year. And given Taylor’s history of generosity, fans can expect she’s going to treat those around her well, financially and otherwise, should her reputation hold true.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrZmpobyzedKwoJ%2BsXaW%2ForXSnptmrJmlvaq6xmaZop9drK61r8eipaBlpKeut7XSZqKepJOawG6zwKacaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rudy-gobert-wife-is-rudy-gobert-married.html><span>←</span><span>Rudy Gobert Wife: Is Rudy Gobert Married?</span></a>
