With that, <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> and her family became huge global stars, and today they own empires worth billions of dollars. The show ended up running for 20 seasons before it wrapped up in 2021. While fans of Keeping Up with the Kardashians were incredibly emotional about the show's ending, soon afterward it was revealed that the famous family is moving to the streaming platform Hulu where they will star in a new reality television show titled The Kardashians.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="How Kris Jenner Helped Kim Kardashian Handle Her Divorce From Kanye West">How Kris Jenner Helped Kim Kardashian Handle Her Divorce From Kanye West</a></span></p><p>Today, we're taking a closer look at just why Kim, Kylie, Kourtney, and co. ended up moving from E! to Hulu. From <a href=#>whether they get paid more now</a> to just how the new show is different from Keeping Up with the Kardashians — keep on scrolling to find out!</p><h2 id=the-kardashian-family-gets-paid-more-on-hulu><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Kardashian Family Gets Paid More On Hulu</span></h2><p>One reason the family ended up starting a new show on Hulu is the money they were offered. While no exact numbers have been revealed, insiders have revealed that it is a nine figures deal. Here's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what Kris Jenner said about their salary</a>: "Well, money always matters. I think that anybody would be foolish to say that money doesn’t matter anymore."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="What Scott Disick Really Feels About Kourtney Kardashian And Travis Barker's Relationship">What Scott Disick Really Feels About Kourtney Kardashian And Travis Barker's Relationship</a></span></p><p>Walt Disney Television’s chairman of entertainment, Dana Walden, revealed that the family isn't cheap. "We stepped up to a great deal that they very much deserve," Walden said. "Who would you want more for your unscripted slate than the Kardashians? They perfectly symbolize our strategy, which is taking big shots, but the right shots, and betting on incredible talent and best-in-class opportunities in each genre."</p><h2 id=all-the-kardashian-jenner-family-members-get-paid-the-same><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>All The Kardashian/Jenner Family Members Get Paid The Same</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Khloe Kardashian revealed that the family gets paid equally this time around.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> "We are all equals," </a>she said. "It definitely played a factor because we give so much of our personal lives up for entertainment. We always have our private family conversations, and we’re pretty brutal, me and my sisters, with what we will settle for or not settle for. But not all money is good money. It has to be a good fit, and Hulu was just the perfect fit for us."</p><h2 id=hulu-is-more-tech-forward-and-on-brand-for-the-family><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Hulu Is More Tech Forward And On-Brand For The Family</span></h2><p>Another reason why the famous family decided to make the jump from E! to Hulu is the fact that the streaming platform <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">is much more "tech-forward</a>." Khloe Kardashian revealed that it is "not so on-brand" for them to "still be on cable" in 2022. Considering that streaming platforms are incredibly popular today, this change is definitely on-brand for the sisters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-family-members-can-shoot-scenes-individually><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Family Members Can Shoot Scenes Individually</span></h2><p>Anyone who has been watching Keeping Up with the Kardashians knows that towards the last couple of seasons it seems to have become very difficult to get all the sisters together to shoot.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="How Kim Kardashian's Sisters Really Feel About Her Plan To Become A Lawyer">How Kim Kardashian's Sisters Really Feel About Her Plan To Become A Lawyer</a></span></p><p>On The Kardashians, things are done a little differently and all the ladies are able to shoot scenes individually which means they can work around their hectic schedules.</p><h2 id=they-won-rsquo-t-have-to-relive-the-drama-months-later><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>They Won’t Have To Relive The Drama Months Later</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On Hulu, the episodes will air much quicker than on E!, which is of huge importance for the sisters. Kim Kardashian revealed: "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">We wanted it to be as current as possible</a>. We hated how long we had to wait. That was, like, the death of us because once we got over something, we had to rehash it all over again." With Hulu, the ladies won't have to relive that drama months after it happens in real life.</p><h2 id=39-the-kardashians-39-has-more-of-a-documentary-style><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>'The Kardashians' Has More Of A Documentary Style</span></h2><p>Kim also revealed to Variety that The Kardashians is different from Keeping Up with the Kardashians when it comes to the style of the show. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Before, on E!, it was totally us and totally amazing</a>, but the episodes were so short," Kim said. "And the producers definitely knew what the E! audience wanted. And this feels a little bit more documentary-style."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-family-wanted-to-close-a-chapter-in-their-lives><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The Family Wanted To Close A Chapter In Their Lives</span></h2><p>When the family announced that Keeping Up with the Kardashians was ending, they revealed that they felt like this chapter needed to end, and they were ready for a break. "This was a dream of all of ours. We never imagined we would get onto season two. Now we're on 20," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian told</a>Grazia USA. "Sometimes we just need a break. It's really simple. We just need a minute to regroup. You know, we haven't had a break for 14 years. We've gone in filming a season, then a spin off and I think there's no other way to say it other than, we just live such big lives. And we have kids now. And they need us."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="Kim Kardashian's Wealth Is Growing Every Year, And She's Not Slowing Down">Kim Kardashian's Wealth Is Growing Every Year, And She's Not Slowing Down</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbalecqaqZ2Zo522orrSZqOemaaaeqZ5xaipZqClocJw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lebron-james-wealth-red-sox-space-jam-2.html><span>←</span><span>LeBron James Increases Wealth With Red Sox As Space Jam 2 Trailer Launches</span></a>
