This revelation was made during a 10th-anniversary gathering of the Oceanic Institute, which was hosted by Juiming and attended by Jonas and Meiying. <span>What Happened To Suyin In Meg 2?

What Happened To Suyin In Meg 2?</span></span></p><p><span>In his speech, Juiming discussed his history with megalodons and the institute, detailing his reasons for creating it and how he merged it with his father‚Äôs Zhang Oceanic Laboratory. He also mentioned that his father died during the original megalodon event and that Suyin had passed away before Meg 2.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The details surrounding Suyin‚Äôs death are limited, as a slide displayed during the party simply confirms that she passed away in 2021, three years after the events of the original movie.</span></p><p><span>The cause of her death and what she did in the years between The Meg and her passing are not disclosed, leaving questions about her relationship with Jonas.</span></p><p><span>It is unclear why the filmmakers chose to kill off Suyin instead of finding another explanation for her absence, as this makes it unlikely for Li Bingbing to reprise her role in a potential sequel.</span></p><p><span>Suyin‚Äôs death is barely mentioned by Jonas or Meiying, which seems odd considering its significance to the story. However, it‚Äôs possible that Li Bingbing may have retired from acting, which would explain the decision to kill off her character.</span></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Big screen, bigger shark. ü¶à Get your tickets NOW to see <a href=# rel=noopener>#Meg2</a> only in theaters August 4: <a href=#>https://t.co/8vwyCdIxO8</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/TfAUqljegb</a></p><p>‚Äî Meg 2 (@MegMovie) <a href=# rel=noopener>July 25, 2023</a></p><p><strong><span>Read More ‚Äì <a href=# rel=noopener><span>Cricketer Sarfaraz Khan Wife Name</span></a></span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikkamytMDIp5mopJyuxLC7w2eaqKVfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSsrameu261zWaknp9dZ3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sam-bakhtiar-net-worth-cause-of-death-age-instagram-wiki-biography-family.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Sam Bakhtiar Net Worth, Cause Of Death: Age, Instagram, Wiki, Biography, Family</span></a>
