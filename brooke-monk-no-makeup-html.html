She flaunted her passion wholeheartedly on her socials.&nbsp;</p><p>The majority of Monk's content features her make-up-clad looks —&nbsp;including her viral foxy-eyes makeup with long lashes and dark eye shadows. Her makeup is praised and imitated by many of her TikTok followers.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But she didn't receive the same amount of appraisal when she debuted her no-makeup looks through a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TikTok video</a>&nbsp;on May 13, 2021, a day after she gave&nbsp;glimpses of her face without makeup in a tutorial video. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In the 30-second clip, Monk revealed she couldn't put on makeup because she had a stye on her eyes.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>As soon as she uploaded the video, her followers grouped into supporters and&nbsp;adversaries.&nbsp;People pointed out how she was nothing without her makeup.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>One commentator wrote, "She is overrated." "Have you seen her without makeup," another added. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As hate rained down on the video's comment section, the teenager <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">made another clip</a>, confronting the&nbsp;criticisms.</p><p>Monk first showcased her face without makeup and wrote about how pretty she felt without it. Then she displayed&nbsp;the hate comments and&nbsp;clapped back at haters, telling them it was all lie.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Her well-wishers were quick to support her in the comment section. "You're stunning. Don't listen to jealous haters," said one. Another wrote, "Be yourself whatever it is you are naturally beautiful."&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Fellow <a href=# rel=follow>TikTok star</a> Leenda Dong commented, "with or without you still look like Disney princess Mah frand."&nbsp;Monk thanked the social media influencer for her supportive words.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Brooke Monk Is Dating Sam Zigg</h2><p>Monk is turning heads&nbsp;with her fabulous looks and her relationship with&nbsp;TikTok star and model Sam Dezz.

Then, one day, Monk suddenly informed him she was coming to LA and asked if he would hang out with her.&nbsp;</p><p>The budding model approved, and the pair spent quality time together before returning home. They went official with their relationship a week later.</p><p>Since then, the lovebirds have enjoyed their relationship while making content together and melting hearts with their adorable chemistry. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJqipLyssYympqejXaO8brnApJyuqF6dwa64</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./teen-mom-2-alum-kailyn-lowry-details-how-she-manages-7-kids.html><span>←</span><span>'Teen Mom 2' Alum Kailyn Lowry Details How She Manages 7 Kids</span></a>
