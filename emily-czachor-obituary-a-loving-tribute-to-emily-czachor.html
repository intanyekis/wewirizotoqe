Emily Mae Czachor, Two identical murders in Indianapolis within days of each other last week are being investigation. In a news release, the Indianapolis Police Department claimed the two homicides have “a number of commonalities” but no evidence links them. However, investigators have noted that both victims were White women in their 50s who were killed “in the same manner.</p><p>” Police uncovered their deaths on the same route and linked them to the city’s far east side. Despite calling both deaths homicides, police have not disclosed how each woman was slain or named a suspect. At a Friday news briefing scheduled “out of an abundance of caution,” Acting Police Chief Chris Bailey asked anybody with information related to either case to contact the department, CBS station WTTV reported. “We need the community’s assistance to understand what these women were doing before they were killed that may help investigators move this case forward,” Bailey.</p><p>The first woman was found dead in a dentist’s parking lot on Indianapolis’ east side on Jan. 27, police and WTTV reported. A second woman was found dead behind a strip mall days later, on Feb. 1. WTTV identified the victims as 58-year-old Shannon Lassere and 52-year-old Marianne Weis. Justin Smith, Lassere’s son, told the station that his mother went for a walk the night of Jan. 26 and never returned, suggesting the two homicides were not a coincidence. CBS News contacted the Indianapolis Police Department for more information but received no answer It’s strange that two separate people, two different days, seem similar.</p><p>It’s bizarre “WTTV quoted Michael Adams, who lives near the murders.Indianapolis police said they are increasing patrols “in the interest of public safety to prevent this type of violence in our community.” “Residents should expect to see more uniformed officers patrolling the area, in vehicles and on foot, and detectives will be canvassing the area in the coming days,” stated cops. “In addition to our homicide unit, IMPD will have multiple units working these cases.” The police department is working with a county forensic services organisation to investigate if substantial forensic evidence can be recovered from the scene and encouraging locals to check private security footage “to see if they saw anything suspicious or out of the ordinary.”</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwscyio7Jlk6%2BupLTOq2SompmpwqK%2B2GaYZqSfq7avs4ytqaKapamybsDOZpymoZyueqTGwJyfqKpf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brie-bella-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Brie Bella Net Worth - Pulptastic</span></a>
