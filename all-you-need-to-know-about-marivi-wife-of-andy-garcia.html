In 1982, when he was 25 years old and his blushing bride was 24, he married Marivi.</p><p>Although the couple is extremely discreet about their relationship, on September 24, 2022, he raved about her in an Instagram post. He captioned the retro wedding photo with the now-64-year-old, “40 blessed years!”</p><p>Andy presented a slideshow of photographs of a young Marivi on Valentine’s Day, February 14, 2021. “Happy Valentine’s Day to the girl who stole my heart!” was the post’s caption.</p><p>And on May 10, 2020, he uploaded another selfie of his wife to Instagram with the comment, “Happy Mother’s Day to my queen, my lady! And to all mothers over the globe! Very sweet!</p><h2><span id=What_He_Has_Said_About_Marriage>What He Has Said About Marriage</span></h2><p>It’s no secret that Andy is still smitten with his leading lady after four decades, considering how often he gushes about her. Despite the fact that he and Marivi are very low-key and live a life out of the spotlight, he has revealed that he has been married for decades.</p><p>He told PEOPLE in June 2022, “It was a lightning strike.” “When we were very young, she really captivated me. When we met that night, it was crystal evident that she was the woman I would spend the rest of my life with.</p><p>Even though the Oscar-nominated actor proposed to Marivi on their first date, they did not tie the knot until seven years later. “She insults me by claiming that I proposed to all the girls that night, which is not true!” he quipped at the time of the publication.</p><p>“Such things are possible. I did not want her to flee.” Although Andy frequently tweets about his girlfriend, Marivi keeps her Instagram account secret.</p><h2><span id=Have_Andy_and_Marivi_Children>Have Andy and Marivi, Children?</span></h2><p>Andy and Marivi have welcomed four children during the course of their forty-year marriage. The ages of their three daughters are 39 for Dominik, 35 for Daniella, and 31 for Alessandra.</p><p>In 2002, the couple welcomed a son, Andrés Garcia-Lorido, age 21. Also, the pleased father has published numerous images of his daughters on Instagram, including one on International Women’s Day on March 8, 2022.</p><p>“My blessings! #nationalwomansday Marivi, Dominik, Daniella, Alessandra, and Violette Rose #internationalwomensday,” he said in the post’s description.</p><p>In October 2021, Andy became a grandfather when Daniella gave birth to her daughter. “Happy Birthday, Dani Girl!” Violette’s Mum,” he captioned a photo of them taken on January 3 with the phrase.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: M.
