Furthermore, the rumor became official after Brillantes made her relationship official with UP Fighting Maroons Ricci Rivero.</p><p>However, the couple has never disclosed the true reasons behind their separation.</p><p>The photo elicited a variety of comments and queries about why the actor is at Diaz’s home. According to Filtrends, the caption on the actor’s Instagram image reads, “Seth is with Chin family, my heart is full of pleasure.”</p><p>Andrea, upon seeing the photographs, sent a cryptic message claiming that she is not in the mood and supposedly unfollows Francine.</p><p>The problem was thought to be a love triangle at that moment. According to Ogie Diaz’s sources, Andrea approached Francine last December at ABS-Christmas CBN’s Special.</p><p>Andrea allegedly barged into Francine’s dressing room to confront her about a photo of her with Seth. The Hollywood vlogger went on to say that as a result of the argument, Seth apparently felt “off” or displeased with Andrea’s demeanor.</p><p>Seth then went to Francine’s house to apologize for the incident. During the visit, Seth posed for photographs with Francine and her family. These are the photographs that recently went viral and sparked a feud amongst their admirers, according to the&nbsp;summit&nbsp;express.</p><p>So, we are unaware of the actual reason and it also seems like the couple ended their relationship in a good term.</p><p>Since he defended Brillantes on Instagram Live late Sunday night, stating his followers to refrain from insulting Brillantes. He emphasized that his friend did not deserve the snide remarks from individuals who have no idea what’s going on in real life.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=andrea-brillantes-relationship-with-ricci-rivero></span>Andrea Brillantes Relationship With Ricci Rivero<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Andrea Brillantes is officially in a relationship with an actor-basketball player Ricci Rivero.

The event marked the beginning of their relationship.</p><p>Brillantes then posted a photo of herself on Facebook wearing the “yes” shirt and clutching a sunflower bouquet. It was my first time seeing a UAAP game, and I had no idea I’d have a boyfriend there. That was incredible, Lord, she wrote on Caption.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rivero expressed his happiness over two events: winning the game against Far Eastern University (FEU) and receiving Brillantes’ “yes.” Both of which occurred yesterday, according to his Twitter page.</p><p>“I GOT TWO WINNERS TODAY!” “#UPFight TAKEN,” he&nbsp;tweeted.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=explore-andrea-brillantes-real-name-and-new-boyfriend-ricci-rivero></span>Explore Andrea Brillantes Real Name And New Boyfriend Ricci Rivero<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Andrea Brillante’s real name is Andrew Blythe Daguio Gorostiza.
