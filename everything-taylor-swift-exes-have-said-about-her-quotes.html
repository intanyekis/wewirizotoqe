While those who date her know that they may be the subject of one of Swift's songs in the future, many take the chance to date her. After all, by all accounts, she is a lovely person to be around.</p><p>While not all the men that Swift has dated have made comments about her after they have broken up, others have. Some of the comments are kind, others not so much. It appears to be based on whether Swift and her ex have been able to split on good terms how the comments fall. <a href=#>That is, save for Joe Alwyn, who has said nothing at all</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=calvin-harris-on-the-aftermath-of-his-relationship-with-taylor-swift><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Calvin Harris On The Aftermath Of His Relationship With Taylor Swift</span></h2><h3 id=dated-january-2015---march-2016>Dated: January 2015 - March 2016</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar52801861-1.jpg><p>According to GQ, Calvin Harris had a hard time dealing with the aftermath of the relationship playing out in the press.</p><p>"It’s very difficult when something I consider so personal plays out very publicly," Harris explained.
