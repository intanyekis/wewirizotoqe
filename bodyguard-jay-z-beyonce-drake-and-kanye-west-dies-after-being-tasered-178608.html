Christiane Jung found him naked and arguing with her husband Markus Jung inside her home. The verbal altercation soon became a violent confrontation, during which Oosterbroek swallowed an unknown substance. When police tried to break up the fight and take the bodyguard into custody, he became aggressive. In attempts to subdue him, officers shocked him with a taser. He was taken to Baptist Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Oosterbroek was 43.</p><p>Our condolences go out to his family and friends.</p><p>Photo Credit: thelifefiles.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5e8pcXGrpirnF2frrp52WaZnrGfo7CmecOrmKSdXZa7pXnKmqWynV2ssrTAjJ2gnqtdlrO1sdFmmZ6hnpx6ta3SnqmenF1mhHmCj3Fm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-did-kal-penn-do-for-president-obama.html><span>←</span><span>What Did Kal Penn Do For President Obama?</span></a>
