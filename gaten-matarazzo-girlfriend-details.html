He started out as Benjamin in Priscilla, Queen of the Desert from 2011 to 2012, and Gavroche in Les Misérables from 2012 to 2013. (2014–15). Matarazzo became known for his role as Dustin Henderson in the Netflix horror-science fiction drama Stranger Things (2016–present). He is also the host of the show Prank Encounters on Netflix (2019–present).</p><h2>Gaten Matarazzo: Personal Life Details</h2><p>Matarazzo was born with a condition called cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD), which he has talked about openly. After he was cast as Dustin Henderson in Stranger Things, the character’s backstory was changed to include the condition.</p><h2 class="sc-bYwzba bTBpYd">Who is Gaten Matarazzo Dating?</h2><p>Gaten has been dating <a href=# rel=noopener>Elizabeth Yu</a> for a long time, and the two of them even went to the premiere of Stranger Things season 4 together. Now, a lot of people want to know more about Elizabeth and how she met him. Elizabeth is also an actress, just like Gaten, but most of her biggest roles are still to come.</p><p>She will be in Somewhere in Queens, a film by Ray Romano that will be shown for the first time at the Tribeca Film Festival in June. In the movie, Romano plays a father who gets involved in his son’s life to make sure he keeps playing basketball well enough to get a scholarship to college. Elizabeth has a small part in the movie, but it’s not the only thing she has coming up.</p><p>She will also play Azula, a fierce firebender who is one of the main bad guys in the animated show, in the upcoming live-action remake of Avatar: The Last Airbender. It’s not clear when that show will come out, but it’s already being filmed. If it does well, it could be a big hit for Netflix like Stranger Things.</p><h2>According To The ‘Stranger Things Actor, His Girlfriend Fits In Perfectly With His Family.</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>How cute are <a href=# rel=noopener>#StrangerThings</a>' <a href=# rel=noopener>@GatenM123</a> and his girlfriend Lizzy Yu?! <a href=#>https://t.co/C7sQOKi9vo</a></p><p>— Just Jared Jr. (@justjaredjr) <a href=# rel=noopener>September 22, 2018</a></p><p>Matarazzo has never hidden his admiration for Yu. In 2018, he told Us Weekly that his girlfriend is a fantastic fit for his family. And when they spend time together, they typically enjoy intimate pool-playing dates at home.</p><p>Matarazzo stated, “My family adores her; she is wonderful.” My brother and sister get along well with her. Gaten Matarazzo is featured in Stranger Things 4: Volume 1, which is currently available on Netflix.</p><h2>In 2018, Gaten And Elizabeth Began Uploading Photos Together For The First Time.</h2><p>Despite the fact that Gaten is only 19 and Elizabeth is also a teenager, the couple has been together for quite some time. Every year on March 4, Gaten posts about their anniversary, and in his most recent entry, he stated that they have been together for four years.</p><p>“I love you. Thanks for being my best friend. “Happy anniversary, goob,” Gaten said in the post, which featured a photo of the two of them standing on a street lined with lights.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Lizzy Yu (@lizz.yu)</a></p><p>Although Elizabeth is less active on social media than Gaten, he frequently appears on her page. In a recent interview with Esquire, Gaten disclosed that he and Elizabeth share an apartment with three cats in New Jersey.</p><p>He admitted that it was unusual for a 19-year-old to live such an adult lifestyle, but stated that he does not find it odd.</p><p>Given the immense success of Stranger Things, it seems unlikely that Gaten will have to worry about money for some time, and Elizabeth is also achieving fame as an actress. Despite all of that chaos, it is clear that Gaten and Elizabeth attended Elizabeth’s senior prom together only a year ago. Even though they already live together, the cast of Stranger Things must go through some rites of passage just like everyone else.</p><h2>What Is Gaten Matarazzo’s Disease?</h2><p>Matarazzo, who is 18 years old, has a rare genetic condition that has changed the way his bones and teeth have grown. Matarazzo has a condition called Cleidocranial dysplasia, or CCD. It happens in one out of every million births and can be passed down or caused by a random change in the genes, according to the organization CCD Smiles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX5yutbHNZqSarJGnrrvGzmaeoqqcm7%2Bqsc2dZJ2dpJa2rb%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fedor-emelianenko-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Fedor Emelianenko Net Worth</span></a>
