Among those backstage were the former Dudley’s, Kevin “Mordecai” Fertig, Kenzo Suzuki & wife Hiroko, Andrew “Test” Martin and Shannon Moore.</p><p>Both Mark “Bubba Ray Dudley” Lamonica and Devon “D’Von Dudley” Hughes were backstage at the TNA Unbreakable PPV and were telling people that they have yet to sign a contract with the company yet, but expected to in time for the September 27th TV tapings for TNA’s debut on Spike TV. They were also overheard talking about why they felt Matt Hardy made a huge mistake in re-signing with WWE this year and adding that he would have “had it made” if he signed with TNA instead.</p><p>Jerry Lynn was backstage at the TNA PPV working in his usual role as an agent. Any future plans for his in-ring return have been derailed in TNA at the moment due to Sean Waltman no-showing the PPV and most likely not being welcome back.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfpJpanFvXZe2qHnTp5hmppWswG7Bz52YrZ1dmba3rdJmrrCdXajBor7SZquemZ1igG6w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jayr-mallari-barber-nba-stars.html><span>←</span><span>Why JayR Mallari Is Barber To The NBA Stars</span></a>
