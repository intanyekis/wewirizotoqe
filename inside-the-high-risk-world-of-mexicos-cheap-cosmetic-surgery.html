Weeks after Rita Rodriguez, a 49-year-old mom of three in Texas, underwent a so-called “mommy makeover” at a Matamoros clinic, she found herself at death’s door.
“My body burned with a high fever; stitches from my tummy tuck came loose while my breasts [with fresh implants] were hot to the touch,” Rodriguez, a TSA employee, told The Post of the 2021 ordeal."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Pus comes out of the incision and the doctor in Mexico prescribes antibiotics instead of going in, removing the implant, washing the tissue and letting it heal.</p><p>“There is a lack of care.”</p><p>And when things go awry, getting them corrected sometimes becomes difficult, as doctors in the States can be reluctant to help Americans who got botched in Mexico.</p><p>MDs in Matamoros, meanwhile, can be dismissive.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Dr. Monica Wentworth, a plastic surgeon in the border city of Brownsville, Texas, sees more than her share of botched cosmetic surgeries done in Mexico. <span class=credit>courtesy of the Wentworth Institute of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery</span></figure><p>“They’ll block your number if you bug them,” said Wentworth. “Cross the border for an elective procedure and you put yourself at grave risk.

The infection went to my brain.”</p><p>In the recent case of patients who contracted fungal meningitis in Mexico, the infections can possibly be traced to shortages of the usual epidural medication.</p><p>Dr. Tom Chiller, who heads up the fungal diseases branch of the CDC, told NBC News: “There could be some bad actors in that space who are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">essentially operating sort of a black-market type of morphine business</a>.”</p><p>Beyond that, augmented breasts can be a game of roulette.</p><p>“Implant selection may be limited to what is available in Mexico instead of what patients desire,” said Wentworth. “For reasons that are never made clear, you may wind up with a DD cup when you decided on a C.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Before (left): a teacher’s botched tummy tuck from Mexico.

For my 31st&nbsp;high school reunion, I found a dress that went up to my neck. I’m angry. This [surgeon] ruined me. It is something I wish I had never done.”</p><p>A Texas healthcare professional, 45, admitted to The Post that she should have known better than to go south for surgery.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Rita Rodriguez (left) had to wear a dress with a high neck to hide scars that came from plastic surgery in Mexico. <span class=credit>courtesy of Rita Rodriguez</span></figure><p>When complications — her breasts turned red, her temperature spiked, color drained from her face — arose after her surgery, she avoided discussing it with doctors she knew from work.</p><p>“I was embarrassed,” said the healthcare professional, who asked to withhold her name for career reasons. “They would have told me that I shouldn’t have done it.”</p><p>But a physician she worked with clocked her sallow skin color and insisted she go to the hospital.</p><p>Once there, a doctor made an incision in her breast. “Fluid that came out was brown — it was like chocolate milk,” the healthcare professional told The Post. “I knew I had an infection, but I didn’t know how bad it was. They removed the implants and I was on antibiotics for six weeks.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Justine Rodriguez went to Mexico for bariatric surgery and left with collapsed lungs. She was hospitalized and required a feeding tube. <span class=credit>Justine Rodriguez</span></figure><p>The root of the complication was as disturbing as the discharged fluid: “I had a bacterial infection. The doctor used dirty instruments,” she claimed. “It was the kind of bacteria that you find in feces.”</p><p>The woman’s sister, who went under the knife in Mexico at the same time, endured her own issues.</p><p>“She had dying tissue on her breast and it left a big scar,” the healthcare professional said. “That same week, a lady died while getting plastic surgery in Matamoros.”</p><p>She admitted that she and her sister were both drawn down there by the bargain prices.</p><p>“I was being quoted $16,000 [for breast implants in the US] and got them done for $3,500 in Mexico,” said the healthcare professional. “I had my breasts redone in San Antonio for $6,000. The experience was good. To people wanting to go to Mexico for plastic surgery, I advise saving up and getting the work done here.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Keuana Weaver died on a Tijuana operating table. <span class=credit>GoFundMe</span></figure><p>But the lure of vanity is so strong that at least one woman, a 42-year-old Texas teacher who normally avoids going to Matamoros even for dinner, steeled herself for a plastic surgery trip last year.</p><p>She signed on for liposuction and a tummy tuck —&nbsp;and got talked into letting the doctor inject stomach fat into her buttocks.</p><p>Waking up from anesthesia, the teacher said, “I felt like I had been hit by a dump truck. I thought that was part of the recovery.”</p><p>It got worse once she returned to the US.</p><p>“I threw up whenever I ate and my skin was gray. I saw a doctor friend and his nurse thought I was going to die,” recalled the teacher, who asked to withhold for reasons of privacy. ” I went to the ER. The first surgeon there didn’t want to work on me. They don’t want the liability of you dying on their table. He said, ‘We’re not going to touch you.’”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Palmer with her four-year-old daughter.

Dr. Wentworth scraped out a pocket of blood and completed the job.”</p><p>Scariest of all, the teacher found out that her butt injection could have been fatal.</p><p>“If they injected me two millimeters to the left, the fat would have gone into a vein that leads to my heart,” she claimed. “They should have never injected so close to that vein. It would have killed me instantly.”</p><p>Looking back, she said, “If I had to do this again, I would not do it in Mexico. After what I went through, I’m grateful to be alive.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29mamxfnru0tcOeZK2glWK1qrPHZqmiq5tixLC%2By51kqJ5dorK5tcKoqmabmJqusXnCqKqmnaSesG6%2F1KuenqqpZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kelly-ripa-loreal-gray-root-color-cover-up-hairspray-beauty.html><span>←</span><span>Conceal Your Gray Hairs With Kelly Ripa's Favorite Root Cover-Up</span></a>
