I haven’t seen his Hallmark movies but if he has been in some, I’m sure he was descent in his roles in them or he wouldn’t have been cast in them. Why a cult leader? He isn’t an evil guy, just a wishy washy one. As I said, I agree about him playing a rock star. I am done with him playing a rock star. Regarding his whispering, I think that is part of Danny’s character. I doubt that he whispers when playing other roles.</p><p>I don’t think he has been in any of the movies. He is involved in writing and directing. And if you believe that everyone cast in a Hallmark movie is a great actor, or even decent, then I certainly believe it when you say that you haven’t watched them</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvDmqWnsV2ewG6%2Fzmaqra2gnrFutdNmqmadnZeus77ArKqippdkhXN%2FmHBs</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-rose-a-maine-journalist-passed-away-at-the-age-of-63.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Rose A Maine Journalist Passed Away At The Age Of 63</span></a>
