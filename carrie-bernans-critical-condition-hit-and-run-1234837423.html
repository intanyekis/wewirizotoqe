The driver later slammed into another car before officers arrived. <a rel=nofollow href=#>PEOPLE</a> confirmed that the hit-and-run took place while officers were following up about “a physical assault involving the 44-year-old male driver of a black Mercedes and a 34-year-old female passenger in the area of 33rd Street and 6th Avenue.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Bernans’ mother, Patricia Lee, shared photos of her following the incident and provided<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234823681> an update</a>. “She [has] a few broken bones, fractures, & chipped teeth but thanking God that she’s alive. Nine people were injured in his attempted escape from the hit & run, including 3 police officers. Police caught him shortly after and arrested him. Amidst the chaos of the New Year’s incident, she’s holding onto an immense sense of gratitude for life itself,” she wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_2042.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Bernans recently<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234768918> gave birth</a> to a son, but he wasn’t with her when this took place.

Despite the injuries sustained in the collision caused by a hit-and-run in NYC, she’s filled with hope and faith in the unfolding of a beautiful new chapter. Please keep her in your thoughts and prayers as she navigate this path toward recovery and new beginnings.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Just days before, Bernans was celebrating the release of <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234812659>The Color Purple</a>. “Overflowing with joy as I invite you to step into the vibrant world of ‘<a href=# id=auto-tag_the-color-purple data-tag=the-color-purple>The Color Purple</a>‘—a film that holds my heart.
