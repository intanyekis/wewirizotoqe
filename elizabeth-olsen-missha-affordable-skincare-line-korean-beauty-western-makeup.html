It has everyone in a frenzy. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Korean culture places a high value on skin care.</a> Korean skincare is more effective than conventional Western beauty methods because it places a strong emphasis on prevention. Parents in South Korea start teaching their kids about skin care at a very young age. Their kids pick up on the value of moisturizer, SPF, and cleansers pretty quickly. A woman's skincare regimen evolves as she gets older. A woman's skin care routine in South Korea frequently includes up to 12 steps.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/6-24.jpg><p>Laneige is a very popular Korean brand of skincare. <a href=#>Sydney Sweeney is an ambassador for them; </a>however, she used the products before ever being paid to use them.</p><p>In Western societies, women typically do not see the importance of skin care until they are in their late teens. Their skin care routine begins with a battle against teenage acne. By the time they hit their 20s, the acne has cleared up, and they are now looking for anti-aging products. Traditionally, American women would go out and buy products recommended to them by department store employees. Then came the internet, social media, and influencers. Sigh. It is hard to know who or what to believe with some of them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>How To Create An Affordable Natural Make-Up Look Like Kate Bosworth</a></span></p><p>You could say that promoting healthy, happy skin is the primary goal of skin care worldwide. But there are some significant variations. Retinol and exfoliating acids, such as glycolic, lactic, and salicylic acids, are often the focus of Western skin-care trends. These are fantastic when utilized properly and sensibly under the direction of a professional, but when overused—as many of us have a tendency to do—they can be extremely irritating and do more harm than good.</p><p>When asked to name the most frequent skin complaints they encounter in practice, dermatologists almost always mention dermatitis, burns, irritation, dryness, and a compromised skin barrier (redness, tightness, breakouts, and rashes), all of which are brought on by using too many harsh ingredients.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-is-korean-skincare-better>Why Is Korean Skincare Better?</h2><p>Western and Korean ingredient lists are very different from one another, and the Korean approach to skincare is much gentler. In Korean skin care, for instance, PHAs (polyhydroxy acids) are much more common. PHAs effectively exfoliate the skin, much like glycolic and salicylic acids, but what makes them unique from other exfoliators is their large molecule size. As opposed to other acids, which could irritate skin, they exfoliate at the surface level without going too deeply.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Elizabeth-Olsen.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, in recent times, Korean skin care has saved our irritated skin barriers. In contrast to drying out the skin, a large portion of Korean skin care focuses on reducing inflammation. In the west, we frequently observe that products with higher percentages of active ingredients, such as multiple acids, can be more astringent or irritating to the skin. When you consider it, it makes sense, and it motivates us to replace all of our current cleaners.</p><p>The Western approach to skin care has been fixated on stripping skin since the early 2000s in order to get rid of the "bad" things like extra oil and clogged pores. Korean skin care, on the other hand, focuses on nourishing the skin.</p><h2 id=where-to-start-with-missah-products>Where To Start With Missah Products</h2><p>So you're not overwhelmed, we went ahead and looked through the products and pulled out what we believe to be a great starting point.
