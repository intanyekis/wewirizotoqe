However, the two didn’t have their first public exchange until 2014, when Fiasco <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted his going rate for personalized verses</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I will personalize a 1 verse song for you. $500.

But when we don’t have respect for ourselves, how do we expect them to respect us? It starts from within.” Lupe Fiasco later tweeted his support for Lamar, a move that would trigger a Twitter battle with Azaelia Banks and Kid Cudi.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kid Cudi's Netflix Special Entergalactic Earned Surprisingly Rave Reviews</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kid-cudi-chimed-in-on-lupe-fiasco-rsquo-s-twitter-exchange-with-azaelia-banks><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Kid Cudi Chimed In On Lupe Fiasco’s Twitter Exchange With Azaelia Banks</span></h2><p>Azaelia Banks, who’d previously voiced her discontent with Kendrick Lamar’s statements, was not particularly impressed when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lupe Fiasco tweeted his support for Lamar</a>. The Chasing Time rapper fired back at Fiasco with the tweet, “@LupeFiasco, you still haven’t made a decent song since I was 17."</p><p>The two had a rather vicious back and forth before Kid Cudi chimed in by tweeting, "Dear Black artist, don’t talk down on the Black community like you are Gods gift to n****z everywhere.
