Though she did mention alongside ET that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the pandemic helped her in a way,</a> especially in terms of privacy during such a sensitive time in her life.</p><p>“But the odd thing about COVID is that it gave me the privacy to do what I needed to do.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=melinda-gates-struggled-with-the-divorce-at-the-start-suffering-from-both-heartbreak-and-anger>Melinda Gates Struggled With The Divorce At The Start, Suffering From Both Heartbreak And Anger</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar50509045.jpg><p>For Melinda Gates, it was all about taking a different path and starting fresh. Speaking alongside CBS News, Melinda revealed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she could no longer go on with her previous circumstances and marriage</a>, despite the fact that she knew the divorce would cause quite the stir worldwide.</p><p>"I needed to take a different path. And so I think, you know, we knew that when the divorce was gonna be announced that it would be a surprise to people," she said. "I felt bad about that, but I probably, I didn't have any sense of how big of news it would be. You never, you can't anticipate something like that."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Did Elon Musk Really Turn Down Bill Gates In A Text Message?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As far as her emotions were concerned, Melinda felt an array of feelings from day to day, which included pure sadness, along with anger.</p><p>"Well, I think it's really important to say, look, I had a lot of tears for many days. I mean, days where I'm literally laying on the floor and the carpet, you know, this close to me, thinking, "How can this be? How can I get up? How am I gonna move forward?'" French Gates said.</p><p>"And days I certainly was angry. I mean, this is painful stuff. And at the end of the day though, I started on this journey of healing, and I feel like I'm starting to get to the other side. And I do feel like I'm turning a page in the chapter now. I mean, it's 2022 and I'm actually really excited about what's to come and life ahead for me," she said.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>How Bill Gates Really Felt About Appearing On The Big Bang Theory</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was a difficult time for everyone involved, but following their settlement, the two were still able to keep things amicable, especially for the sake of their foundation.</p><h2 id=melinda-gates-was-able-to-get-through-it-and-even-worked-with-bill-once-they-were-divorced>Melinda Gates Was Able To Get Through It, And Even Worked With Bill Once They Were Divorced</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Bill-Gates.jpg><p>Melinda's work with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is ongoing, therefore keeping things amicable with her ex was necessary for the greater good. Given her commitment to the foundation, Melinda would do her best to keep things together and lead, despite the fact that she was crying just an hour before to the meeting.</p><p>“I kept working with the person I was moving away from, and I needed to show up and be my best self every single day. So even though I might be crying at 9 a.m. and then have to be on a video conference at 10 a.m. with the person I’m leaving, I have to show up and be my best,” she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I learned as a leader that I could do it. It reminded me that the foundation calls me to be my best,” French Gates added.</p><p>Last year in 2022, Melinda wouldn't say that the two were friends, but she did reveal that things were amicable between both sides, particularly from a business aspect.</p><p>"Friends is a different word for me. And, you know, that might come over time. But for me, there's still healing that needs to happen. Certainly, I wish him well. I don't wish him harm. And I think we have a productive working relationship, and I think that will continue."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiknqSZo7Giecaaq56rXZy8tXnSoq9mmpmhuaq7zWagp2Wjqbykt9Jmm66qmaO0brDIr6arm5Vir7bAjK2fnmWgp7yksdKsZLCZo2K9orXNn6ylZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marc-lasry-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Marc Lasry Net Worth Milwaukee Bucks Owners</span></a>
