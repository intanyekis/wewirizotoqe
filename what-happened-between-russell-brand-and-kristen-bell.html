"Naturally Kristen would be the perfect woman for me. And the perfect guy, that's still me," he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=#>The Good Place star</a> gave an honest answer: "I think I tend to be, someone who is funny, laughing is important. I love someone who is kind. That's probably the number one because if you are rude to the waiter it's not just that. If you think I might just kick your ass it's very unnecessary."</p><p>Bell also revealed that she and Brand were "shoved" in a room together, so they could get to know each other better. "We come up with those ourselves. We were shoved into a room about a week after knowing each other and were told to use our yoga expertise and we came up with 15 of the most awkward sexual positions possible," the actress said of developing their aerobics bit in the film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"They did shove us as well," added <a href=#>the comedian-turned-self-style guru</a>. "We didn't want to go in that room! All we had to entertain us was positions. Luckily our chemistry was good so we came up with some very elaborate whilst troubling for the back."</p><p>In a separate interview, Bell admitted that she "loved" working with Brand despite his controversial image. "Actually, I loved working with Russell," she said. "I may be the only woman in the world who would shout that from the rooftops, but I did."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Awful Thing Casting Directors Would Say To Kristen Bell Before She Got Famous</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-russell-brand-amp-kristen-bell-date>Did Russell Brand & Kristen Bell Date?</h2><p>After news broke that Brand and Perry had just gotten engaged, Bell recalled how she threatened the Arthur star so he'd never make a move on her on the set of Forgetting Sarah Marshall. "He didn't try to mess with me or get in my pants," she shared. "He knew I would lop his n**s off."</p><p>In another interview, she also said: "I made it really clear from the beginning that I would sock him in the b***s if he tried anything. So he was intimidated." Still, she revealed that Brand wasn't actually that bad.</p><p>"Russell loves everyone to know that he's a womanizer and he's done all these strange things, but I think secretly hiding inside Russell is a very nice boy," Bell explained. "I had a lovely time with him because he was a bit protective towards me.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Howard Stern Tried To Troll Russell Brand On-Air But The Comedian Wasn't Having It</a></span></p><h2 id=russell-brand-had-an-odd-reaction-to-kristen-bell-s-pregnancy>Russell Brand Had An Odd Reaction To Kristen Bell's Pregnancy</h2><p>In 2013, Brand wrote an open letter about his struggle with drug addiction on his official Facebook page. There, he confessed that he thought about taking heroin when "a beautiful woman told me she was pregnant and it wasn't mine." He then revealed that he was referring to Bell. He also posted a photo of them from Forgetting Sarah Marshall and captioned it: "Kristen Bell (wonky girl had just told me she was pregnant)."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In October that year, Bell and Dax Shepard also tied the knot at The Beverly Hills courthouse. For years, there have been <a href=#>rumors about the two having an open marriage</a>. It's probably due to Shepard's previous open relationship. He once opened up about it when he said that at the beginning of his relationship with his wife, there was "a ton of jealousy…for pretty good reasons."</p><p>"I had been in an open relationship for nine years, I was blacked out a big chunk of my life. You know, there were a lot of things for her to be concerned about," he continued.</p><p>However, it eventually changed. "But, I'd say once we got engaged, some kind of switch for me seemed to change," the actor said. "And I find her to be incredibly not jealous, which is an incredibly hot characteristic in a partner."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmqqWowKa4y2aZq5memXqiusNmoquho6myr3nBnqOlZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./291714-tom-bradys-dad-tom-brady-sr-is-a-meaning-html.html><span>←</span><span>Tom Brady's Dad, Tom Brady Sr, Is a Meaningful Figure in His Life Facts about the Quarterback's</span></a>
