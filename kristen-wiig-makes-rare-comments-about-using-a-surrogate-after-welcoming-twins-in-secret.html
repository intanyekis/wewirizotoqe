Now that she’s years out from the experience, Wiig feels more comfortable sharing her story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“When you go through it, you meet other people who are going through it, and it’s almost like this secret little — the whispering conversation at a party. It feels like not a lot of people talk about it,” the actress explained.</p><p>Wiig and her husband, Avi Rothman, decided to use a surrogate after three years of trying with the help of IVF. “It is such a private thing, but maybe it doesn’t have to be,” she explained. “It’s part of my story and part of how I got my amazing family.”</p><p>Kristen and Avi welcomed twin daughters in 2020, which she revealed during a Saturday Night Live monologue; fans weren’t even aware the couple were expecting.</p><h2 id=choosing-surrogacy-wasn-rsquo-t-easy-for-kristen>Choosing Surrogacy Wasn’t Easy For Kristen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/screenshot-2024-03-15-at-9-09-15-pm.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I remember when our doctor mentioned going other routes and I was just like, ‘Nope. Don’t ever bring that up again. I’m getting pregnant. I’m doing this,’” <a href=#>Wiig said in 2020 about why she decided</a> to eventually consult a surrogate, emphasizing it wasn’t an easy decision. “I finally realized that I just needed help. And, thank God, we found the most amazing surrogate.”</p><p>Celebrities may choose surrogacy for various reasons, including medical complications, career demands, or personal preferences. Surrogacy offers a solution for individuals facing fertility issues or health concerns that may prevent pregnancy.</p><p>High-profile figures like Kim Kardashian have openly discussed their surrogacy journeys, with Kardashian using a surrogate for her third and fourth children due to health complications. Other celebrities, such as Nicole Kidman and Sarah Jessica Parker, have also opted for surrogacy but have kept details private. This discretion allows them to maintain control over their personal lives while still expanding their families through surrogacy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wiig hasn’t confirmed whether she has plans to expand her family further. Kristen Wiig met her partner, Avi Rothman, in 2016, and the couple began dating shortly afterward. Rothman, a writer, actor, and producer, has supported Wiig's career and is known to keep a low profile in the public eye. The couple has maintained a private relationship, often avoiding the spotlight, and they have been spotted together at various events and outings over the years. The couple is notoriously private about their daughters and largely keeps them off social media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiiq6GjqbKvedaioKBlnZa4pr%2BMq5irnV2YvK65xKerrGWRl7y2wIyuqqKml2Kubr%2FUq6mon5Gpsm6txa2cq2Wnmrmku8yipaBlpKy2r7%2BMoqVmq5WYv6bAjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jerome-flynn-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jerome Flynn Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
