<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Carolyn Anderson Obituary, Longtime OCP Board Member And Supporter Of Omaha Community Playhouse</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Carolyn Anderson Obituary, Death – </strong>It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of Carolyn Owen Anderson, a cherished member of the Omaha Community Playhouse (OCP) family, and a dedicated advocate for the arts, unity, and inclusion. Carolyn’s journey was marked by a tireless commitment to making the world a better place, and her impact on the Omaha community will be remembered for generations to come. Carolyn, the daughter of longtime OCP supporters Ed and Dee Owen, had an enduring love for the arts that began at a young age. Throughout her life, she nurtured this passion by adopting numerous OCP productions, contributing to the growth and vibrancy of the local theater scene. Her unwavering support for OCP was a testament to her belief in the power of the performing arts to transform lives.</p><p>One of Carolyn’s most remarkable contributions was her collaboration with Susan Baer Collins in launching the “Playhouse Play-House” Saturday events for the Nebraska Theatre Caravan. These events became a highlight of the winter months, bringing together diverse groups to enjoy a Caravan production, savor lunch, and engage in a variety of workshops, including music, dance/movement, and puppetry. Carolyn’s dedication to creating inclusive and accessible arts experiences for all was evident in these initiatives. In recognition of her outstanding advocacy and contributions to the arts, Carolyn was honored with the Governor of Nebraska’s Arts Award in 2020. This accolade celebrated her tireless efforts to promote the arts, support individuals with disabilities, and foster unity and inclusion within the community. Carolyn’s work extended far beyond the stage, as she collaborated with numerous organizations that shared her passion for making a positive impact.</p><p>Among the organizations she supported were WhyArts, BLUE BARN Theatre, Great Plains Theatre Commons, No More Empty Pots, Coordinating Neighboring Friends, Heartland Family Service, Habitat for Humanity, Tri-Faith Arts Initiative, Intercultural Senior Center, Urban Abbey, and Park United Methodist Church. Her involvement with these diverse groups showcased her dedication to building bridges and creating a more inclusive society for all. Carolyn’s presence was deeply felt throughout OCP and the entire Omaha community. Her kindness, passion, and unwavering commitment to the causes she held dear left an indelible mark on those who had the privilege of knowing her. Her legacy will continue to inspire us all to work towards a more inclusive and vibrant artistic community.</p><p>A memorial service to celebrate Carolyn’s life will be held at the Omaha Community Playhouse on Monday, October 16, at 11 a.m. Following the service, a luncheon will be hosted in the Owen Lobby, providing an opportunity for friends, family, and community members to come together and remember the remarkable woman who touched so many lives. As we mourn the loss of Carolyn Owen Anderson, let us also remember the incredible impact she had on our community and the enduring legacy of advocacy, unity, and inclusion that she leaves behind. In her memory, may we all strive to carry forward the torch of her passion and continue the work she so passionately believed in.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZbDprrLsmSmnZ2kv6qty6xlnKedZLCivs6lsKdlkaOxpr7SqKVmp5Kewbat0bJkpaeenMGqucRmppyoXZe8or7DZqSepZKav26tzZ1krK2gpbyzwMSrZKieXaS6orTAZpqopZ2qu6rA2GanpZmpnby2v8Ro</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jenna-jamesons-wife-jessi-lawless-relationship.html><span>←</span><span>What Is Jenna Jamesons Private Marriage To Jessi Lawless Really Like?</span></a>
