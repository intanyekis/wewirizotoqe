The 36-year-old <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hitmaker</a> revealed that <a href=# id=auto-tag_lil-yachty data-tag=lil-yachty>Lil Yachty</a> encouraged him to do so after an overwhelming <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">homophobic reaction</a> from fans.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The 6 God is currently on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s All A Blur</a> tour with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">21 Savage</a>, and, per usual, he has shared performance photos and behind the scene images of his time in each city he stops in. On Friday (July 7), the “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Search & Rescue</a>” rapper shared a photo where he can be seen wearing large diamond earrings and pink nail polish that sent the internet into a frenzy days before. Lil Boat took that opportunity to poke fun at the Toronto superstar.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Boy got them heavy hangers in his ear,” the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Let’s Start Here.</a> artist wrote. The Boy replied in all caps, “Get out my comments you told me to paint my nails so I stop biting them and now the world is being homophobic for the first time since Rich Flex… which wasn’t that long ago now that I think about it… wait is the world homophobic? Smh.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Lil Yachty encouraged Drake to “woo-sah” as he isn’t supposed to partake in these outbursts for the public to see. The “Poland” rapper also comforted his friend by saying, “They just don’t get u bro #UDIFFERENTAF.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Given the “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Oprah’s Bank Account</a>” duo’s relationship and comedic demeanors, it is safe to assume this exchange was a joke. However, it also seemed intended to expose how inclined people can be to use antiquated ideas of masculinity to judge men, especially in the realm of Hip-Hop. For as much progress as the world has made in embracing men’s vulnerability, self-expression, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>LGBTQ+</a> individuals as a whole, this Drake situation shows there are still some ways to go.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Similarly, back in April, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Cam’ron faced backlash</a> for his comments on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Michael B. Jordan</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Jonathan Majors’ </a>tender photoshoot. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Dipset</a> member uploaded photos of the two embracing one another and wrote in the caption, “The reason I didn’t go see creed,” hinting at an issue with men being intimate with one another. The Harlem rapper retorted by saying he <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>cannot be canceled</a> when he already canceled himself.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5m%2ForfEZqmerpWWubR5y6KjZrGRmLW1xYypmKKmpGK7orXLrGShp52kvam7waKaZqqVlrC1tc6nZGpqY2mEeHyYcWpo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carlos-alcaraz-tennis-player-wife-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Carlos Alcaraz Tennis Career, Wife, Net Worth, And Family</span></a>
