Dave's Netflix show 'My Next Guest Needs No Introduction', is set for a return on May 20th. We can expect a stacked line of guests which thus far includes Billie Eilish, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Cardi B and Ryan Reynolds.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Angelina Jolie Never Appeared On David Letterman's 'Late Show' Again After This Awkward Interview</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Will Smith has gone completely silent since the 'Oscar' slap took place. <a href=#>He only issued one statement via social media,</a> apologizing for his actions.</p><p>"Violence in all of its forms is poisonous and destructive. My behavior at last night’s Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable. Jokes at my expense are a part of the job, but a joke about Jada’s medical condition was too much for me to bear and I reacted emotionally."</p><p>"I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris. I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness."</p><p>Fans are eager to see what takes place during the interview, but for the time being, let's look back at a memorable moment from the 'Late Show', which features Will Smith's hilarious reaction to Dave gushing over pics of his wife.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=will-smith-poked-fun-at-david-letterman-for-checking-out-jada-s-magazine-photos>Will Smith Poked Fun At David Letterman For Checking Out Jada's Magazine Photos</h2><p>During the interview, David Letterman pulls out the 'Essence' Magazine, which has Jada and Will on the cover.</p><p>"Oh here we go, my goodness," David Letterman says looking at the cover. "Do you mind if we take a look at this?"</p><p>Smith responds, "Hey, hey, I don't like what's in your voice, what are you talking about man."</p><p>"You looking at my woman with all the stuff on," Will further says as the audience laughs.</p><p>"I can look at her, she's in a magazine," Letterman says, "just lower your tone," Smith hilariously responds.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>David Letterman Made It Obvious He Did Not Want To Interview Marilyn Manson</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Letterman hilariously downplays the situation, telling Smith, "Oh you've got plenty to worry about with me. You think she's in Tokyo, well guess again."</p><p>Dave proceeds to show a wedding picture of the two, as Smith hilariously says, "That's the way a woman should look at a man, Dave."</p><p>To cap off the hilarious moment, Dave shows a photo of the two in the magazine, with his own head looking through the window. The moment caused Will and the audience to completely lose it.</p><p>Clearly, the two always had great chemistry and during a time like this, that's exactly what Will Smith needs.</p><h2 id=will-smith-left-to-india-after-the-oscar-slap>Will Smith Left To India After The 'Oscar' Slap</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Will Smith has kept very silent and as it turns out, <a href=#>he took a spiritual trip to India</a>, in an effort to better his mental health. Will was seen overseas, and he was all smiles with the fans. Hopefully, such a trip can aid in giving the actor some mental clarity, in the midst of the bumpiest time of his career.</p><p>Jada would also briefly touch on the matter, <a href=#>stating that the family will come forward and discuss the matter in public</a> when the time is right.</p><p>"Considering all that has happened in the last few weeks, the Smith family has been focusing on deep healing. Some of the discoveries around our healing will be shared at the table when the time calls," read the statement. "Until then... the table will continue offering itself to powerful, inspiring and healing testimonies like that of our incredibly impressive first guest. Thanks for joining us, Jada."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Surely, fans are anticipating the moment and how the Smith family will respond to all the drama.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston Repeatedly Refused To Answer This Awkward David Letterman Question</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGqsIywoKWkXai6qsDHZpuoZaedsq95w5qtopxdobK1wMSrpJqmXayutHnGrqqhoZ6cerDCxKtko5mUlnqxtc2knK2sXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lucas-maurice-morad-jagger-dating-girlfriend-net-worth-earnings-wiki-bio.html><span>←</span><span>Lucas Maurice Morad Jagger Dating, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Earnings, Wiki-Bio</span></a>
