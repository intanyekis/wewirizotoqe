I look forward to being a part of your growth, and I will always be right by your side through thick and thin. You give me happiness I never knew existed. You have my heart forever and always.”</p><p>Brandon, 44, shares the teen with ex-wife <strong>Melissa Ashworth</strong>, as well as son Seth, 14. After their 2012 split, the Texas native moved on with<a href=#><strong> Kelly Clarkson</strong></a>, and they share daughter River, 7, and son Remington, 5.</p><p>The <a href=#>Voice</a> judge <a href=#>filed for divorce from Brandon in June 2020</a>, and a source exclusively told Us Weekly at the time that the Kelly Clarkson Show host was <a href=#>“hopeful” about their coparenting dynamic</a>.</p><p>“Brandon only has the kids 25 percent of the time,” an insider told Us. “Kelly and Brandon don’t communicate directly regarding the kids. They use a computer program that is popular between divorcing parents involved in contentious proceedings. Nannies and their lawyers are also used to communicate.”</p><p>In February of the following year, the “Walk Away” singer explained to her NBC show’s viewers why<a href=#> coparenting had been “tough,”</a> saying, “I know with me and Brandon, it’s just a difficult thing because we’re in different places, and it’s like, we both agree on the main things, but it’s a hard thing when you’re not together all the time, for me personally. … As long as you make sure it’s about the children and their best interests, then we’re both on board.”</p><p>The songwriter was <a href=#>awarded most of the duo’s assets</a> in August, including their Montana ranch. A judge ruled to uphold the exes’ prenup as well, and a source told Us that same month that Clarkson “hasn’t and will never look back.” The insider said, “<a href=#>The marriage was really, really awful at the end</a>. She had a lot of questions that he just couldn’t answer. … She only stuck it out for as long as she did for her kids.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The exes, who have yet to finalize their divorce, previously <a href=#>disagreed on expanding their family</a>. One month prior to their breakup, Clarkson told <a href=#><strong>Gordon Ramsay</strong> </a>that she wanted to conceive again.</p><p>“I so want another child, and my husband is like, ‘No! We have four!’” the <a href=#>American Idol </a>alum said during a May 2020 episode of her talk show. “You get baby fever when you see them and you’re like, ‘Oh, I miss the chubby little legs and the little face.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGabqpGjsbC6jJujmpubqMGwr8qsZJ2ZpZy1tbHRZqqarpGju6K0jKKqZqiimrSvrc2tZLChpJ16cr%2FTZpqhoZyZfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sonja-morgan-slammed-as-bravo-star-claims-to-pop-liposuction-stitch-during-sex-with-trucker-while-filming-welcome-to-crappie-lake-thats-gross.html><span>←</span><span>Sonja Morgan slammed as Bravo star claims to pop liposuction stitch during sex with trucker while fi</span></a>
