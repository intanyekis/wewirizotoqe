<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Melissa Gorga Bikini Body: Real Housewives of NJ Star's Red Swimsuit</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>After three children, <a href=#><strong>Melissa Gorga</strong></a> definitely worries about how her body looks in a bikini — but not in the way one would think. “I know there’s a lot of women who try to minimize their backsides . . . but I actually want a bigger booty!” the married mom of Antonia, 7, Gino, 5, and Joey, 3, told <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> at a bikini photo shoot for our annual Hot Bodies issue, out Fri., May 24. “I do a lot of squats and lunges to bulk and lift it up.”</p><p>Sticking to a strict thrice weekly workout schedule, Gorga, 34, often hits up group classes at New York City’s Soul Cycle, or lifts weights with her husband of eight years, <strong>Joe Gorga</strong>. Admitting that she was about 10 pounds heavier when she first met her husband, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star slimmed down after each of her kids was born.</p><p>Teaching healthy habits to her three children from a young age, the fit “I Just Wanna” singer — who donned a sexy red Inca&nbsp;bikini at <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a>‘s shoot — says she’s become more conscious of showing skin as a mom. “I’m a firm believer in showing a little bit, but keeping a lot a secret,” Gorga tells <strong>Us</strong>, adding that her stomach is her favorite body part. “If I’m going to show leg, then I’m not going to show much boob. I feel like everything in small drips is great.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Vowing never to deprive herself of her favorite sweet treats or Sunday Italian dinners, Gorga — who reaches for berries when cravings hit — is willing to log hours at the gym to see results. “I definitely work out now harder than I’ve ever worked out in my life. It came naturally to me before I had children, and now I have to work for it, which I’m used to. I’ve always been a hard worker. I don’t mind working for it.”</p><p>For much more from Melissa Gorga, pick up Us Weekly‘s annual Hot Bodies issue, on stands Friday!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGamnZyewLStjKCmq5%2BRYr2wv8SsZKKmXaiyucWMq5ydZZKeuKq6yGagZq%2BRo8FurYyboKCflad6o7vOrbBmamBmgHN%2FlGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./josh-hutcherson-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Josh Hutcherson Net Worth: Earnings and Investments,Personal Life</span></a>
