The Bears fired running backs coach David Walker, head coach Matt Eberflus announced Wednesday morning.
ESPN reported Chicago made this decision “because of behavior in the workplace.”
The 53-year-old had already been “reprimanded” by the Bears’ human resources department and a second instance resulted in this firing, per the report.
“As the head coach, we are building a program and have standards to uphold to as a staff and organization both on and off the field, and those standards were not met,” Eberflus told reporters Wednesday."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
