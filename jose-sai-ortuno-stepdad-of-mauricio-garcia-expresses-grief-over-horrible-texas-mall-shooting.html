The 33-year-old gunman killed eight people and injured seven others on Saturday, May 6.</p><p>Garcia allegedly had Neo-Nazi and white supremacist beliefs and was removed from the army due to "mental health concerns" in 2008. He was armed with an AR-15-style rifle and was shot dead by the Allen police officer on the scene.</p><p><strong>READ MORE&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 class=split>Who is Jose Sai Ortuno?</h2><p>Jose Sai Ortuno, a drywall installer residing in the Dallas area, condemned his stepson's actions in the strongest terms. Expressing his grief, Ortuno said, "You know how people are feeling about this, this horrible thing. Believe me, it's horrible. And it's double for us," he told . The reference to "double" seemingly alluded to the profound impact of the bloodshed on both the victims and Garcia's own family. Ortuno further stated, "We want answers, too," emphasizing the family's desire to understand the motives behind Garcia's horrific actions.</p><h2 class=split>'Right-wing death squad'</h2><p>Authorities are diligently investigating the incident and have been in contact with Garcia's parents and acquaintances, hoping to shed light on what drove him to carry out such a deadly rampage. Prior to the attack, Garcia had posted a series of hateful messages online targeting various groups, including Jews, women, and people of color. Investigators are also exploring the gunman's potential affiliation with neo-Nazi organizations and ideologies. At the time of the shooting he had a patch on his chest that read "RWDS" at the time of the massacre, the letters are thought to stand for "right-wing death squad."</p><p>Garcia had also exhibited the same patch on a tactical vest in posts made on social media platforms frequented by extremist groups, where he also shared content promoting harm towards minorities. Furthermore, his online activity included approximately two dozen posts related to the mall, including observations about the busiest times, suggesting a premeditated plan for maximum casualties. At present, investigators have not disclosed the precise motive behind the tragic shooting that occurred on Saturday. Furthermore, they have yet to shed light on the specific reasons why Garcia specifically chose to target the Allen shopping mall, situated approximately 25 miles north of Dallas, where his parents are residents.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoop%2Bosm6%2FwKJkqKqkqruwedKtnKmckZl6sLKMppiuqpmYtrB5xpqpnKGRYrK5vNGeqqydo2K0s7XEn2SorpWneqm70augm6SVYsGmxMCsZKaZnKF6tLTOqKuippc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-danuel-house-still-married-to-wife-whitney-house-524576-html.html><span>←</span><span>Is Danuel House Still Married to Wife Whitney House?</span></a>
