The Grammy winner compared his body image struggles to his brother-in-law Rob Kardashian, who left West’s May 2014 wedding to&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a></strong> because he was insecure about his appearance.</p><p>“I had plastic surgery because I was trying to look good for ya’ll,” West told TMZ on May 1. “I got liposuction cause I didn’t want ya’ll to call me fat like you called Rob at the wedding and fly home before me and Kim got married … I didn’t want ya’ll to call me fat so I got liposuction.”</p><p>“I was drugged the f—k out, bro. I was drugged out,” he added. “I was on opioids. Two days after I got off of opioids and I was addicted to opioids.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In addition to his drug confession, West has recently made headlines for his political views and controversial comments, including calling slavery a “choice,” which received major backlash from other celebrities. <strong><a href=#>Kris Jenner</a></strong> <a href=#>opened up</a> about her son-in-law’s behavior during a Friday appearance on<a href=#> The Ellen DeGeneres Show.&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></p><p>“You know, Kanye has a lot of love for all of you, all of his fans, and everybody who’s been there to support him forever,” Jenner, 62, said. “And, I know that he will explain himself in his own way. And, I think that anything he does – and I just think this is important to say is – he always does things with really good intentions. So, I’m going to let him explain himself when the time is ready and … I just keep rolling on. Trying to keep up.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmZ6usm7DxKyrZqqRpcBurcGorK1ln6W2sLXDZpidnJmYwaq7zWamp2WemsRuwNGaraKrXaiwsMDTZqqoppdk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brooke-monk-no-makeup-html.html><span>←</span><span>Brooke Monk Responds to Hate Comments for Her No Makeup Look</span></a>
