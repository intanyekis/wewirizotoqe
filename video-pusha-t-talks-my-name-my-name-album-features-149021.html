Music’s “Mercy,” Kanye West’s “So Appalled,” and his own “Exodus 23:1.”</p><p>The G.O.O.D. music signee also sat down with <a href=# id=auto-tag_fuse-tv_3 data-tag=fuse-tv>Fuse TV</a> during his trip to discuss his upcoming debut solo album “<a href=# id=auto-tag_my-name-is-my-name_3 data-tag=my-name-is-my-name>My Name is My Name</a>.” Describing the project as a compilation of classic works by The Notorious B.I.G, Ma$e and Raekwon, Pusha explained the album’s essential components.</p><p>“I like to look at the album as a fusion of, I wanna say, four albums — four of my favorite albums,” he said. “I wanna say the Life After Death album, Ma$e Harlem World album and Raekwon Purple Tape. That level of RZA production, those are like the perfect moods and description of diversity of what I wanna hear in rap: the raw RZA edge, I wanna hear the lyricism of a Biggie, the arrogance of a Ma$e in Harlem World.”</p><p>Pusha also revealed the “My Name is My Name” producer lineup, including G.O.O.D. leader Kanye West as well as Swizz Beatz, The-Dream, Nottz and former Star Trak affiliate Pharrell Williams. The rapper divulged that the album would have a few R&B elements sprinkled in the mix.</p><p>“I even wanna give you a little bit of R&B. R&B is a major part of my black music experience. It makes for great music in the club and it’s great-feeling.”</p><p>The album also features guest appearances from Rick Ross, Future, 2 Chainz and Kendrick Lamar. Pusha told Fuse that he would be meeting with Kanye West in Paris in the coming weeks to finalize the cuts on “My Name is My Name.” He also said that a release date would be coming soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6u2pbHOZqeuq5iWerV505qjpKtdosZuusCmnGalqWK7ornEZpilmqWieqexwK2sq52jYn51hY9raGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./george-w-bryan.html><span>←</span><span>George W.
