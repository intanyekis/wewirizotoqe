She is a singer who has released nine studio albums, but is probably best recognized for releasing the single “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going”, for which she won a Grammy award. She is also known for being an actress, who starred in the Broadway musical “Dreamgirls”. Her career in the entertainment industry has been active since the late 1970s.</p><p>So, have you ever wondered how rich Jennifer Holliday is? According to authoritative sources, it is estimated that Jennifer’s net worth is over $10 million, as of mid- 2016. She has been accumulating this amount of money through her successful involvement in the entertainment industry, not only as a singer but also as an actress.</p><h3>Jennifer Holliday Net Worth $10 Million</h3><p>Jennifer Holliday was brought up by her father, Omie Lee, who was a minister, and her mother, Jennie, who worked as a schoolteacher. She studied at the High School of Engineering Professionals, and later earned a Doctor of Music honoris causa from Berklee College of Music, Boston Massachusetts, in 2000.</p><p>Jennifer’s career began in the late 1970s, when she auditioned for a part in the Broadway show “Your Arms Too Short To Box With God” in 1979. Two years later, she got the part of Effie Melody White in the musical “Dreamgirls”, which confirmed her as a singer as well as an actress. After the successful performance of the song “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going”, she ventured further into themusic industry; her debut album came out in 1983, entitled “Feel My Soul”, which reached No. 6 on the US R&B chart. Since then, she has released eight more albums, such as “Say You Love Me” (1985), “Get Closer To My Love” (1987), “I’m On Your Side” (1991), “Goodness & Mercy” (2011), and most recently “The Song Is You” (2014), but unfortunately none of these albums achieved the success of her debut release.</p><p>Jennifer has also stayed active on stage, making appearances in such productions as “Harlem Suite” (1988), “Grease” (1995), “Black Nativity” (2002), “Like Jazz” (2003), and “The Color Purple” (2014), among others, all of which have increased the overall size of her net worth.</p><p>Furthermore, Jennifer’s net worth increased also from her acting talents, as she haS made several TV appearances, including in TV series such as “The Love Boat” (1986), in the role of Dr. Charlene Thomas, which was her debut appearance. In 1997 she was selected for the role of Lisa Knowles in the TV series “Ally McBeal” (1997-2001), and most recently she appeared in the TV series “Happily Divorced” in 2011.</p><p>Thanks to her numerous skills, Jennifer has received several prestigious awards, including the Tony Award for Best Lead Actress in a Musical for her work on “Dreamgirls”, Grammy Award Best Female Performance, Rhythm & Blues for the performance of the song “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going”, and Grammy Award for Best Inspirational Performance, Gospel for the song “Come Sunday”, among many other awards.</p><p>If to talk about her personal life, Jennifer Holliday has been married twice, firstly to musician Billy Meadows for just nine months in 1991, and then to Rev. Andre Woods, a minister, for slightly longer in 1993-94. Her current residence is in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=18.723021582734><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Jennifer Holliday</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>October 19, 1960</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Riverside, Texas, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress, Singer</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Spouse</td><td>Andre Woods (m. 1993–1994), Billy Meadows (m. 1991–1991)</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Omie Lee, Jennie Lee</td></tr><tr readability=0.32558139534884><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/ladyjholliday</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.24770642201835><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/jenniferhollidaydreamgirlhttp://www.instagram.com/jenniferhollidaydreamgirl</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.30434782608696><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://myspace.com/thejenniferholliday</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0391057/</a></td></tr><tr readability=12><td>Awards</td><td>Tony Award for Best Lead Actress in a Musical, Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical, Grammy Award for Best Inspirational Performance, And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going, I Am Changing, One Night Only, Tony Award for Best Lead Actre...</td></tr><tr readability=11><td>Nominations</td><td>Grammy Award for Best New Artist, NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical, And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going, I Am Changing, One Ni...</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Movies</td><td>The Rising Place, Paul Simon & Friends: A Night of Gospel Glory, The Rising Place, Paul Simon & Friends: A Night of Gospel Glory</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=4.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=9><td>1</td><td>Twenty years ago when I was in 'Dreamgirls,' I was always a joke because I was huge.
