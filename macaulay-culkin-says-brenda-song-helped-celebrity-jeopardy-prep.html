I’m already all nervous,’” he joked.</p><p class=p1>Culkin and Song met in 2017 while <a href=#>costarring in <i>Changeland</i></a>, which hit theaters two years later. “It’s great,” Song<a href=#> exclusively told <i>Us Weekly </i>in September 2018</a> of their romance. “I don’t like to talk about my personal life, but everything’s wonderful and I’m happy.”</p><p class=p1>The low-key couple <a href=#>secretly welcomed their first child</a>, son Dakota, in April 2021.
