One such wrestler is Dani Luna.</p><p>is 24 years old. She was born in the Town of Croydon in England. Back in December of 2016, <a href=#>the English-born star</a> made her wrestling debut. Back then she competed under her real name Chloe Smith. The first promotion that Luna wrestled in was at Evolution. Since then, she has wrestled in multiple independent wrestling promotions such as PROGRESS, RevPro, and other wrestling promotions.</p><p>Luna made a name for herself on the Independent Wrestling circuit. She then signed with WWE. Luna wrestled in the NXT UK promotion. In early 2022, she was released from the Stamford-based promotion. After that, she also suffered a severe injury. She tore her ACL. Later in the year, she returned to in-ring competition. One of the biggest wrestling promotions she worked with after returning from injury was IMPACT Wrestling. Luna took part in the <a href=#>Nashville-based promotion’s UK Invasion Tour</a>.</p><p>Recently, the 24-year-old star took to Twitter to reflect on her career since being released from WWE. She claimed that this past year has been the best period of time in her entire wrestling career.</p><p>“1 year ago today I came back from tearing my ACL and getting released from the WWE (a bad year lmao) I truly believe the last 365 days have been my best body of work in my entire career. Work don’t stop. More to do?,” Dani Luna tweeted.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>1 year ago today I came back from tearing my ACL and getting released from the WWE (a bad year lmao)<br>I truly believe the last 365 days have been my best body of work in my entire career.<br>Work don't stop.
