While some may argue the glorification of violence, death, and ignorance that is perpetuated in most mainstream rap, these are the attributes that cause rappers to stand out and dominate in their respective genre. But <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a large majority of mainstream rappers</a> often become the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">unforgettable stars of top Hollywood movies</a>. Classics like Poetic Justice, How High, Boys N The Hood, and New Jack City show us how multi-talented they are.</p><p>Here are some of the rappers that made it big in the music and acting industry.</p><h2 id=ice-t>Ice-T</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tracy Lauren Marrow, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">more famously known as Ice-T</a>, is considered one of the early originators of the 'gangster rap' genre of rap music. Early in his career as a rap artist, he began as a vocalist for the American heavy metal band Body Count, which produced the controversial song, Cop Killer. Ironically, despite the obvious message of defiance towards police, one of Ice-T's most iconic acting roles was that of an undercover police officer named Scotty Appleton in the 1992 crime thriller New Jack City. He also starred in other films like Ricochet, Trespass, and Surviving the Game, to name a few. Among many other roles, one of his most noteworthy is that of Special Victims Unit Officer Odafin Tutuola in Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.</p><h2 id=ice-cube>Ice-Cube</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As another proponent of early gangster rap, O'Shea Jackson Sr., known professionally as <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ice Cube</a>, showcased his lyrical mastery in the highly criticized group, N.W.A. Similar to Ice-T's Cop Killer, N.W.A. was formed as a result of the struggles facing urban youth and rising police brutality. From there, Ice Cube went on to launch his movie career in 1992 with his stunning performance in Boyz N The Hood. Then there was the movie franchise, Friday, in 1995, followed by the critically acclaimed Three Kings <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">starring Mark Wahlberg</a> and George Clooney, as well as another successful movie franchise in 2002 - "Barbershop." Like Ice-T, Cube also landed roles as a police officer in Ride Along and 21 Jump Street. Since his debut in 1992, he has starred in nearly 40 films in total.</p><h2 id=tupac-shakur>Tupac Shakur</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps one of the most controversial and legendary rap artists of all time is the late Tupac Shakur, also known as 2Pac.
