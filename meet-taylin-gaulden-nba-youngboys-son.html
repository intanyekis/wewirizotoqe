Despite being just a kid, Taylin is already regarded as a celebrity because of his dad’s fame.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Taylin Gaulden’s Biography</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full name:</strong> Taylin Marquez Gaulden</li><li><strong>Nickname:</strong> Tay Tay</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> March 29, 2017</li><li><strong>Taylin Gaulden’s Age:</strong> 6 years old</li><li><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Louisiana</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:&nbsp;</strong> Pisces</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Single</li><li><strong>Taylin Gaulden’s Parents:</strong> Trinia Nia and Kentrell DeSean Gaulden aka NBA YoungBoy</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> Kayden Gaulden, Kamron Gaulden, Kamiri Gaulden, Armani Gaulden, Kacey Alexander Gaulden, Kodi Capri and Kentrell Gaulden Jr.</li><li><strong>Hair Color:</strong> Black</li><li><strong>Eye Color:</strong> Dark Brown</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being NBA YoungBoy’s son</li></ul><h2><strong>Taylin Gaulden Is NBA YoungBoy’s Third Child</strong></h2><p>Taylin Gaulden born Taylin Marquez Gaulden is NBA YoungBoy’s son. He was born on March 19, 2017, as the third child among several children his father has sired with different women. Every year, Taylin celebrates a new year on March 19 which shows that his star sign is Pisces and he is 6 years old.</p><p>He is an American national and a native of Louisiana and he currently resides with his family in Los Angeles, California. Taylin Gaulden was born to his dad, NBA YoungBoy, and mom, Trinia Nia while they were teenagers. His father, NBA YoungBoy was 17 years old when Taylin was born.</p><p>As a kid, Taylin is raised alongside his other siblings by his dad while his mother is also seen posting pictures of her time with her son on her Instagram page.</p><h2><strong>Who Is Taylin Gaulden’s Mom?</strong></h2><p>Taylin Gaulden’s mother is named Trinia Nia. She became famous after her affair with the rapper, NBA YoungBoy but her fame was short-lived. After she had her son, Taylin Gaulden, Nia was soon forgotten by the media. On the other hand, her baby daddy is the famous one and his fame is a result of his so far successful music career.</p><p>However, Nia does not seem to be very active on social media thus, the information about her family, academic qualifications, and career journey is not publicly available.</p><h2><strong>Taylin Gaulden’s Parents Were Never Married</strong></h2><p>Taylin Gaulden’s father, NBA YoungBoy has been in a series of relationships with several women, and Taylin’s mother, Trinia Nia, happened to be one of those ‘many women’. However, the rapper has never been exclusive with anyone.</p><p>Taylin is therefore the product of a one-time affair between his parents. His parents had a one-night stand that resulted in his pregnancy. Since his birth, NBA YoungBoy and Trinia Nia have not been married yet. Also, his mom does not have any other children for NBA YoungBoy.</p><p>Though Taylin Gaulden’s parents are not together, they are not enemies as they have found a way to co-parent him. The young boy lives mostly with his dad and other siblings in Los Angeles, California. His dad has been very hands-on with regard to raising him and his siblings.</p><p>The reason for this may not be far from the fact Taylin’s dad grew up without a father himself. The rapper has revealed this himself in his interviews, explaining that he was raised by a single mom. Thus, he wanted to be present and emotionally attached to his kids which is the motivation behind his involvement in raising Taylin and his siblings.</p><h2><strong>NBA YoungBoy Asked for a DNA Test When Taylin Was Born</strong></h2><p>Taylin Gaulden was born to NBA YoungBoy and Trinia Nia but his dad was not so excited about his birth because Taylin’s birth came with many controversies. Just like many music stars, Taylin’s dad has a long list of women and baby mamas but when Trinia Nia hinted that she was pregnant, NBA YoungBoy had his doubts.</p><p>According to reports, NBA YoungBoy’s distrust was because he had only had a one-night stand with Nia, which according to him lessens the probability of him being responsible for the said pregnancy. As a matter of fact, he also suspected that she had affairs with another man and so, he needed proof to accept Taylin as his son.</p><p>Another reason why the rapper had doubts was that he had just discovered that his second son, Kamron Gaulden, was not actually his and so to clear his doubts about Taylin, NBA YoungBoy requested a DNA test and fortunately for Taylin, the paternity test came out in his favor.</p><h2><strong>Taylin Gaulden Was Born Into A Large Family</strong></h2><p>As earlier stated, Taylin Gaulden’s dad has a long list of girlfriends, consequently, Taylin was born among seven siblings with different mothers. He has two older brothers, three younger brothers, and two sisters; all from his dad’s side but none from his mom.</p><p>His eldest sibling is Kayden Gaulden. Kayden is a year older than Taylin. He was born on July 4, 2016, when their father was 16. Additionally, Kayden’s mom is Nisha Keller. Taylin’s second brother is Kamron Gaulden who was born on July 19, 2016, and his mom is Starr Dejanee. Even though it later came out that NBA YoungBoy isn’t Kamron’s father, the former accepted him as part of his family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/320568483_119899357451370_8694340302910553566_n-1.jpg><p>Still, on Taylin’s list of siblings, his first younger brother is Kamiri Gaulden. Kamiri was born on July 6, 2017, and is a few months younger than Taylin. Taylin’s fourth brother, Kacey Gaulden, is two years younger than him as he was born on February 13, 2019.</p><p>The last of Taylin’s brothers is Kentrell Jr Gaulden. Kentrell Jr. was born to NBA YoungBoy by Iyanna Mayweather. His birth took place on January 9, 2021, and his mom is the daughter of American boxer, Floyd Mayweather.</p><p>Taylin Gaulden Has Only Two Sisters. The first of Taylin Gaulden’s sisters is Armani Gaulden. She was born on June 19, 2020, and is the daughter of NBA YoungBoy and Nisha Keller.</p><p>Additionally, Kodi Capri Gaulden is Taylin’s youngest sister. Kodi first opened her beautiful pair of eyes on November 26, 2020. Her mom, Drea Symone is an actress from Houston and NBA YoungBoy’s ex-girlfriend.</p><h2><strong>Taylin Gaulden and his Mom Survived an Auto Crash</strong></h2><p>When Taylin Gaulden was about a year old, he survived an accident that would have claimed his life. On June 26, 2018, Taylin was in his dad’s Lamborghini alongside his parents and siblings before the car ran into a tree. Thankfully, every occupant came out without any serious injury, however, the Lamborghini was spoiled beyond repair.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunC5xJ6rZqyRrrmquoygmK6klJq7brrBmmSyp6WjtKO72KxkrKeeZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gwyneth-paltrow.html><span>←</span><span>Gwyneth Paltrow Married, Husband, Children, Net Worth, Income, Earnings</span></a>
