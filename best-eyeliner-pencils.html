If staying power is your main concern, for instance, focus your efforts on waterproof formulas that don’t budge once they dry. If you want a versatile, smudgy formula, opt for an oil-based liner that advertises its blendability. And if you have sensitive skin, a “clean formula” without potential toxins or allergens is a smart pick. Below, take a look at the most important factors to consider before selecting an eyeliner pencil.</p><h2 class=section-title>What to Consider When Choosing the Best Eyeliner Pencil</h2><h3>Staying Power</h3><p>The staying power of eyeliner pencils varies dramatically depending on the formula. Gel-based and waterproof liners tend to last the longest and smudge the least, while cream-based liners have a medium staying power and easy blendability. Kohl or kajal eyeliner pencils don’t always have the longest staying power, but are very easy to apply and offer rich pigments.</p><h3>Ingredients</h3><p>While a long-lasting eyeliner means you won’t have to reapply as often or worry about smudging, these formulas often have more irritating or <a href=# rel=noopener>potentially toxic ingredients</a>. If you have sensitive eyes, look out for ingredients such as parabens, phthalates, carbon black (often listed as Black No. 2) and aluminum powder.</p><h3>Application Device</h3><p>There are two main types of eyeliner pencils: wooden pencils and mechanical pencils. Wooden pencils are traditional and usually have the most product. They can also be sharpened to a very fine point. Mechanical pencils can also be sharpened, but don’t often reach as fine of a point because the formula tends to be creamier.</p><h3>Type</h3><p>Pencil eyeliners typically have formulas that are gel-based, cream-based, or kajal/kohl-based. A gel-based pencil has a semi-solid formula that stays put, while a cream-based formula is great for creating a smoky eye. Kajal or kohl-based pencils create great cat eyes in the absence of liquid liners.</p><h3>Price</h3><p>The least expensive eyeliner pencils sell for 99 cents, while the most expensive sell for about $45. The cost of most pencils falls between $6 and $15, which makes sense: The materials used to make most eyeliner pencils are usually not expensive. In general, we don’t think you need to spend more than $20 to get a good pencil.</p><h2 class=section-title>What Are the Different Types of Eyeliner Pencils?</h2><p><i>There are three main types of eyeliner pencils, each of which has different strengths.</i></p><h3>Gel</h3><p>A gel eyeliner pencil is one that contains a gel-based formula. Traditional gel liners come with a brush and a dipping pot, which contains a moisture-rich formula. In contrast, gel pencils are slightly drier. Why choose a pencil over a dipping pot? Gel pencils are easier to apply and stow away in a <a href=# rel=noopener>makeup bag</a>. While they may not give you the same precision as a brush, they still offer rich pigment and great staying power.</p><h3>Cream</h3><p>Cream eyeliner pencils are usually mechanical pencils filled with a rich and smooth formula. They tend to be moisturizing and easy to blend, so they can easily create a smoky, party-ready look. Note that cream-based pencils tend to smudge more easily than gel ones.</p><h3>Kohl/Kajal</h3><p>A kohl or kajal eyeliner comes in pencil form, and the formula is soft and smooth. Kohl and kajal are typically the driest formulas of all eyeliner pencils, making them great for beginners — they don’t run and they can help you create a sharp wing (building your confidence to try a liquid liner).</p><p>Note that all products advertised as “kohl” or “kajal” in look and feel don’t actually have any kohl or kajal, since these are colorants that have been <a href=#>banned in the US</a> for containing high amounts of lead. These days, eyeliner pencils are made with safe kohl and kajal alternatives.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6eyt7XEsKpompWowW6x2J6joqaVp3qxsc2coKWrXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1442648-tony-deppen-pitched-ron-funches-winning-gcw-match-wanted-it-to-be-most-wcw-esque-match-ever.html><span>←</span><span>Tony Deppen Pitched Ron Funches Winning GCW Match, Wanted It To Be Most WCW-esque Match Ever</span></a>
