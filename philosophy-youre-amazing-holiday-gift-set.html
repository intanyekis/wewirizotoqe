If you’re still working on putting together your holiday shopping list, we think you should give yourself some grace — by giving someone else some Amazing Grace. The holiday season can be super hectic, whether you’re wrapping up big projects at work instead of wrapping up presents or trying to plan a family gathering with 20+ people."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The holiday season can be super hectic, whether you’re wrapping up big projects at work instead of wrapping up presents or trying to plan a family gathering with 20+ people.</p><p>We want to make it a little easier for you (with the help of Amazon) by recommending lovely gift ideas that ship out fast. We mentioned <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this Amazing Grace set</a> because it will likely come in handy. It’s an affordable Premium Beauty find already packaged in a pretty pink gift box — and that’s just the beginning of why we love it!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Philosophy You’re Amazing Gift Set</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$32</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, December 13, 2022, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>This perfect duo is a gift that spans basically all ages and occasions. It’s a nice choice for a teen getting into self-care and discovering new brands, or perhaps for a hard-working woman who needs a stress-free nighttime routine. A busy parent who needs to carve out some “me” time will adore it, but we also know a grandparent would appreciate the messaging on the containers, as it really reflects the giving spirit of the holiday season. This set will “sleigh” at Secret Santa and white elephant exchanges too!</p><p>Let’s actually dive into what the two products are in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this gift set</a>. You get two fan-favorites in the iconic Amazing Grace scent, a clean, feminine fragrance with notes of bergamot, muguet blossoms and musk. We say two products — but there are more than two uses for them!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Philosophy You’re Amazing Gift Set</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$32</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, December 13, 2022, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>First is a shampoo, bath and shower gel in one. Massage into wet skin and hair for a fresh, moisturized clean. Second is for when you’re out of the bath/shower. It’s a whipped, light-as-air body crème. Massage into skin (not hair!) and it should melt right in for a silky-smooth finish!</p><p>If you’re a Prime member, you could have <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this set</a> in just a couple of days, giving you plenty of time to wrap it up for this year’s holidays. And we definitely don’t hate that the shipping is free!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Philosophy You’re Amazing Gift Set</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$32</a> at Amazon!
