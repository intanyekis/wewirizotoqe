According to <a href=#>Deadline</a>, the comedian did not say anything about the incident itself but hinted when he’ll share more of his perspective during a comedy show on Friday (April 8) at the Fantasy Springs Resort-Casino in Indio, Calif.</p><p>“I’m OK, I have a whole show and I’m not talking about that until I get paid. Life is good. I got my hearing back,” Rock said at the beginning of his performance, the outlet reported.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chris-Rock-Will-Smith-Slap-1.jpeg><p>As the fallout from the slap continues, Smith has issued an apology and faced his own consequences. On his own accord, the veteran actor <a href=#>resigned</a> from The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. As an organization, The Academy has decided to ban the award-winning actor from all events for the <a href=#>next 10 years</a>. He will be allowed to keep his first and only Oscar award, which he accepted moments after the infamous slap.</p><p>“We want to express our deep gratitude to Mr. Rock for maintaining his composure under extraordinary circumstances,” expressed The Academy.</p><p>For the remainder of his set, Rock joked about Hillary Clinton, the Kardashians, corporate diversity, having children, being single, and more according to Deadline. He is currently on the Ego Death <a href=#>tour </a>with dates from April through November across the United States. The 57-year-old’s last tour was the Total Blackout stand-up tour in 2017 and 2018, and he also released the stand-up special <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Chris Rock: Tamborine</a>&nbsp;in February of the latter year. Both marked his return to the live stage after nearly a decade.</p><p>Amid the Ego Death tour, Rock and Kevin Hart have a headlining minitour, Rock Hart: Only Headliners Allowed, this July across five days in New York and New Jersey.</p><p>View the full Ego Death tour schedule as well as the schedule for Rock Hart: Only Headliners Allowed below.</p><h2><strong>Chris Rock Ego Death Tour Dates</strong></h2><p>April 2 – Atlantic City, NJ @ Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa<br>April 2 – Atlantic City, NJ @ Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa (LATE SHOW)<br>April 8 – Indio, CA @ Fantasy Springs Casino<br>April 9 – Reno, NV @ Silver Legacy Resort Casino<br>April 9 – Reno, NV @ Silver Legacy Resort Casino (LATE SHOW)<br>April 14 – Hollywood, FL @ Seminole Hard Rock Casino Hollywood<br>April 15 – Hollywood, FL @ Seminole Hard Rock Casino Hollywood<br>April 16 – Durham, NC @ DPAC<br>April 20 – Bethlehem, PA @ Wind Creek Bethlehem<br>April 21 – Bethlehem, PA @ Wind Creek Bethlehem<br>April 22 – Baltimore, MD @ The Lyric<br>May 6 – Las Vegas, NV @ The Colosseum at Caesars Palace<br>May 7 – Las Vegas, NV @ The Colosseum at Caesars Palace<br>June 3 – Uncasville, CT @ Mohegan Sun<br>June 7 – Columbus, OH @ Ohio Theatre<br>June 9 – Cincinnati, OH @ Taft Theatre<br>June 11 – St. Louis, MO @ Stifel Theatre<br>June 14 – Indianapolis, IN @ Murat Theatre At Old National Centre<br>June 16 – Cleveland, OH @ Connor Palace at Playhouse Square<br>June 18 – Toronto, ON @ Scotiabank Arena<br>June 21 – Denver, CO @ Bellco Theatre<br>June 23 – Prior Lake, MN @ Mystic Lake Casino Hotel<br>June 24 – Prior Lake, MN @ Mystic Lake Casino Hotel<br>June 25 – Mt Pleasant, MI @ Soaring Eagle Casino<br>July 3 – Las Vegas, NV @ The Colosseum at Caesars Palace<br>July 7 – Oakland, CA @ Paramount Theatre-Oakland<br>July 27 – Orlando, FL @ Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts<br>July 29 – Atlanta, GA @ Fox Theatre Atlanta<br>Aug. 27 – Funner, CA @ Harrah’s Southern California Resort and Casino<br>Aug. 28 – Phoenix, AZ @ Arizona Federal Theatre<br>Sept. 16 – Detroit, MI @ Fox Theatre Detroit<br>Sept. 26 – Pittsburgh, PA @ Benedum Center<br>Oct. 6 – New York, NY @ Radio City Music Hall<br>Oct. 13 – Chicago, IL @ Chicago Theatre<br>Oct. 18 – Seattle, WA @ Paramount Theatre<br>Oct. 21 – Vancouver, BC @ UBC @ Doug Mitchell Thunderbird Sports Centre<br>Oct. 27 – Washington, DC @ DAR Constitution Hall<br>Nov. 17 – Los Angeles, CA @ Dolby Theatre</p><h2><strong>ROCK HART: ONLY HEADLINERS ALLOWED DATES:</strong></h2><p>Thursday, July 21 – Wantagh, NY – Northwell Health at Jones Beach Theater</p><p>Friday, July 22 – Newark, NJ – Prudential Center</p><p>Saturday, July 23 – New York, NY – Madison Square Garden</p><p>Sunday, July 24 – Holmdel, NJ – PNC Bank Arts Center</p><p>Monday, July 25 – Brooklyn, NY – Barclays Center</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5i1s7XSZqmom5tiu7DAjK2YpaOZo7Ruv8uap2atnqm2rXnPmqCdZWFngHWClG9scGtf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cactus-moser-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Cactus Moser Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
