He said in a statment: “Hunting can be a controversial topic. I apologize to any of those who took offense to the video. It definitely wasn’t my intent to offend anybody. Other Mountaineers have gone and shot multiple deer with it before. I’ve taken it with me deer hunting before, also.”</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Here is an image</a> of the mascot having shot the bear with his musket.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/2012/12/kimble-and-bear.jpg alt="mascot shot bear with musket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6yytMCMr6Crn5mjtqJ5zJqqnKekYsCpu9NmmZ6ZomK6tr%2FKnqtmaWJpgnSFjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./oscar-adrian-bergoglio-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-180475-html.html><span>←</span><span>Oscar Adrian Bergoglio Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biogra</span></a>
