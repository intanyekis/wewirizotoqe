Weeks after <b><a href=#>Darren Criss</a></b> shared a slightly NSFW <a href=#>photo to Instagram</a>, the <i>Glee</i> alum opened up about his initial hesitation to post the eye-popping picture.</p><p>Alongside the now-viral photo, in which he’s posing in the mirror completely nude — except for a strategically placed Speedo that he is holding instead of wearing — Criss wrote: “So what’s more red? My sunburn, my speedo, or YOUR FACE??? <a href=#>#ACSVersace</a>“</p><span class=caption></span><p>Hitting the “share” button on the Tuesday, May 30, post wasn’t Criss’ first instinct, but after getting words of encouragement from his loved ones, the actor, 30, decided to go for it. “It actually took many many days to figure out if I was going to do it or not,” Criss told <i>Us Weekly </i>at the iHeartRadio&nbsp;Much Music Video Awards in Toronto, Canada, on Sunday, June 18. “I asked a couple of my friends, I asked my girlfriend and they all agreed I should do it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/darren-criss-b5c31a0b-70ad-4caa-a33e-959cf00bdb2c.jpg><p>The <i>American Crime Story </i>actor, who is dating writer/producer <b>Mia Swier</b>, joked that the photo is something that every member of the photo-sharing app should be entitled to post “I’m not much of social [media] guy, but I feel like everyone gets to do one,” he explained of the post, which has more than 240,000 “likes” to date. “Life is too short. Sammy Davis Jr. once said, ‘If they don’t talk about you, they don’t give a damn.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Criss also opened up about shifting his focus from acting to music while <i>American Crime Story</i> is on hiatus. “I’m concentrating mostly on my music and my band,” he said. “My band is called Computer Games and our debut came out in April. It’s a band with my brother and basically the project we have been working on our entire lives.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadmaKnsq95wqugrKtdmsWxuMCipaxlnqqxpnnVoqmapF2osq2yyJ5ksGxobYRzhY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aaron-carter-cause-of-death-drowning-xanax-alprazolam-huffing.html><span>←</span><span> Aaron Carter's Autopsy Reveals Cause of Death, Xanax and Huffing Led</span></a>
