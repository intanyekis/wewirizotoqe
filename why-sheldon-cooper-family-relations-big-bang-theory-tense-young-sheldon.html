The near-death experience during the <a href=#>Medford tornado in the season 6 finale of Young Sheldon</a> changed the family dynamic, with Missy and her father reconnecting.

No one wants to break the news of the changes to teenage Sheldon, who famously loves order and consistency. He comes home to realize Georgie, Mandy, and the baby have moved in.

In the second season of The Big Bang Theory, Penny and Sheldon argue to the point that Sheldon throws her laundry out the window.

But which has been more lucrative for the actor?</span><p>Sheldon often tells stories about his late father using his mother’s china for target practice and shooting the television screen because his football team lost. He also explains that his father has an affair, yet on Young Sheldon, George only flirts with a neighbor and appears a loving father. George has already passed by the time The Bang Bang Theory story begins, so he is only mentioned as a memory by his widow and children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sheldon's mother, Mary, was the first member of the Cooper family to be introduced in The Big Bang Theory. She appears throughout the 12 seasons, acting judgmentally and very god-fearing. The younger and older Mary are very similar, although the Young Sheldon version is much more mellow.</p><p>Sheldon's twin, <a href=#>Missy, is a fan-favorite character</a> on Young Sheldon but only appears twice on The Big Bang Theory. As a child, she wasn't as academically intelligent as her brother, but she was wise and good at reading people and making friends. Fans were surprised to see she had to become a successful adult when she appeared as Amy and Sheldon's wedding. Georgie is the least seen member of the Cooper family, not appearing until season 11 of TBBT. Although his entrepreneurial nature can be displayed in the younger version.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdqLWmuMOopWabn6S9pr6Mn5imoZyuerOxy5qroqeeqHqjtcZmmZqml2LBqbHOq7BmrJWjwKZ52Kisp59dqLWmuMOopWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./man-united-beat-chelsea-6-5-on-penalties-in-the-first-all-english-champions-league-final-video.html><span>←</span><span>Throwback: See John Terrys slip which handed the UCL to Man United in Moscow 2008 (Video)</span></a>
