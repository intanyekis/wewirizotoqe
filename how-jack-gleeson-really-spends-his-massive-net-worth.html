To play a character so despicable so well, Gleeson had to have some skills, even if fans wanted to hunt him down and get rid of him once and for all. With everything that Gleeson brought to the table, we all expected that he'd go on to bigger and better roles. However, that doesn't seem to be the case. After leaving Game of Thrones in season four, <a href=#>Gleeson took some time off from acting</a>, but now he seems to be getting back into it. He has to, or else his impressive net worth will disappear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jack-gleeson-39-s-net-worth-is-pretty-impressive>Jack Gleeson's Net Worth Is Pretty Impressive</h2><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Gleeson is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worth about $6 million,</a> which is really impressive considering he's only had about 12 roles throughout his short acting career. However, since Game of Thrones is Gleeson's most significant project, we can assume that most of his net worth stems from his time on the show.</p><p>As a child, Gleeson started his acting career by appearing in a couple of shorts including, Moving Day, Fishtale, and Tom Waits Made Me Cry. At only 13 years old, Gleeson got the golden ticket when he was chosen to play a "Little Boy" in Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins.</p><p>Gleeson only got into acting because he thought it looked fun. "If the community center hosted Karate classes instead, I might be a Karate person, but for some reason, they happened to have acting classes, so I went to them," Gleeson told Vulture.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Game of Thrones Ruin Jack Gleeson?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"All I wanted to do growing up was to act in a big film or TV show and I achieved my utmost dream," he told the Independent. After that, Gleeson appeared in Shrooms, the TV show Killinaskully, A Shine of Rainbows, and All Good Children. After all this, Gleeson was cast as Joffrey Baratheon in Game of Thrones. He wasn't the biggest fan of the behind-the-scenes work on the show, including sitting in the makeup and wardrobe rooms for hours, but playing Joffrey pulled in an impressive paycheck.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gleeson-earned-250-000-in-the-first-two-seasons-of-39-game-of-thrones-39>Gleeson Earned $250,000 In The First Two Seasons Of 'Game Of Thrones'</h2><p>In the early seasons of Game of Thrones, Joffrey didn't have as significant a role in the show as he did in his last couple of seasons, but that doesn't mean Gleeson didn't earn a good chunk of cash. According to Wealthy Genius, Gleeson earned more than <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$250,000 from the first two seasons</a> alone.</p><p>Gleeson's earned even more for his final two seasons. He earned $450,000 for seasons three and four in 2013 and 2014, respectively. By the time he left the show, Gleeson was worth more than $1 million. But after his exit, <a href=#>he took a hiatus from acting</a> unexpectedly. Gleeson said he felt uncomfortable with fame.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Jack Gleeson Still Close To The Rest Of The 'Game Of Thrones' Cast?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"People can be wealthy and not mean, but this status thing... Some people, when they become famous, they feel better, they feel more worthy. That's what makes me really uncomfortable. I try to eschew that as much as possible," Gleeson said. So, for the next six years, Gleeson led a pretty normal life out of the spotlight, living in a flat in London. So it's safe to say that even though Gleeson is worth $6 million, he doesn't exactly spend his money like a celebrity.</p><p>But in recent years, <a href=#>he's returned to acting</a>. After his six-year hiatus, Gleeson starred in the BBC series Out of Her Mind for a couple of episodes. This year he's starred in a stage production of Chekhov’s The Seagull and the Irish film Rebecca's Boyfriend. Behind the scenes, Gleeson has founded his own company, Collapsing Horse, as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking to the Independent recently on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his stage work</a> on Chekhov's The Seagull, Gleeson said, "My part [Konstantin], he’s not on stage for the whole thing but it’s going to be in Coole Park [in Galway], outside, so even when you’re off stage, you still have to be present. You can’t go to the toilet or anything. But in terms of acting fitness or feeling rusty, yeah, definitely."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> These 'Game Of Thrones' Actors Couldn't Be In The Same Room Together</a></span></p><p>Outside of acting here and there, Gleeson likes to live in privacy, and he's fine with not being in big blockbusters or series' like Game of Thrones anymore. "I'm happy to sacrifice a big paycheck for my happiness." So Gleeson probably doesn't live in glamour like his Game of Thrones co-stars like Kit Harington and Emilia Clarke. He definitely doesn't live like his on-screen love interest, Sophie Turner, who lives in a lavish mansion with her husband, Joe Jonas. But Gleeson's happy with how his career has turned out so far. Still, we miss him and his incredible acting skills.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Who Is The Richest 'Game Of Thrones' Star In 2021?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dn66kt4ygo56do6S7br7EmqOlsV2ovaa6w6xkoaGjYrqiv9KirZ5lnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./erin-ziering.html><span>←</span><span>Erin Ziering</span></a>
