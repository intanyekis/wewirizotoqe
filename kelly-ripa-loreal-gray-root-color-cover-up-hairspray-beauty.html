But when my roots come in, they look translucent.” Ripa revealed that her haircare hack is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">L’Oreal’s Magic Root Cover-Up</a>.</p><p>“When I don’t want my white popping through, I use this.

The spray requires little effort, looks good, and is so fast. Spray it on the parts you need, and you’re done.
