She’s still passionate and he’s still chill, but their personalities complement each other now.”</p><p>The source claims that Julia and Danny disagreed on where to live with their family full-time.

His career is in LA, plus he wanted to be in Southern California to stay closer to his family. He did move, though, but it was to appease Julia, who pretty much put her foot down on the matter,” the source added.</p><p>During an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">appearance on The View last month</a>, Julia opened up about what she believes makes her marriage work, and a lot of it has to do with the functionality of the house, she claims.</p><p>"My sister, who has been married for 25 years or 26 years, I think, she says the secret to a happy marriage is two bathroom sinks and two phone lines. Two sinks is important,” she explained.</p><p>“I think marrying the right person is important, I think lots of kissing hello and goodbye is really, I think, a critical detail to daily life," Julia added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihrqSZlnqzu8Geqa2rXZmur7rYZqSonJWneqWxzbJknaGmpL%2BksYyao6Wdl5bBqrvNrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jonathan-cain-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jonathan Cain Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
