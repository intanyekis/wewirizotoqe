Martinez</strong> blew half a million dollars on lots and lots of top-shelf booze, specifically champagne. Of the 169 total bottles of bubbly purchased, there were 48 bottles of Dom Pérignon, 43 bottles of Ace of Spades, 60 bottles of Moët & Chandon, five bottles of Veuve Clicquot, 12 bottles of Perrier-Jouet, and a bottle of Cristal.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Aside from champagne, the athletes also celebrated with multiple bottles of Don Julio tequila and Belvedere vodka, as well as 11 bottles of Jameson whisky and 17 bottles of Jack Daniels.</p><p>The beverages (with taxes and other fees included) cost around $300,000, and on top of that the Sox apparently left a hefty $195,000 tip for the club’s waitstaff.
