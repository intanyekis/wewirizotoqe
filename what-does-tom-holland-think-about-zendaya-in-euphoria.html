While keeping mum about the ins and outs of their relationship, the pair has slowly grown more comfortable talking about each other. Tom has frequently admired Zendaya's incredible work ethic and impressive professional endeavors</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Zendaya's Dating History And Other Interesting Facts About The Euphoria Star</a></span></p><p>With Euphoria being one of the biggest shows in the world, fans have been eager to know what Tom thinks of his girlfriend's involvement. Lucky for us, Tom has let his true feelings about the show slip on more than one occasion. Here's how the Spider-Man No Way Home star really feels about Euphoria and Zendaya's performance.</p><h2 id=does-tom-holland-watch-euphoria>Does Tom Holland Watch Euphoria?</h2><p>Tom Holland does watch Euphoria, and who can blame him? Not only is it <a href=#>the second-highest watched show from HBO</a>, but who wouldn't want to see what their partner was doing? Zendaya has an extra special connection to Euphoria, both starring in and producing the show. During his Tom Holland: The Puppy Interview with Buzzfeed, the Spider-Man No Way Home star spilled the beans about his love of Euphoria.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the interviewer asked what TV show or movie, past or present, the actor would want to be on, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he immediately responded, "I would be in Euphoria."</a> Jokingly, he added he would be perfect for the part of Maddy, played by the iconic Alexa Demie. "I love the show and I love season two. I visited a lot while they were shooting it and I really, really enjoyed it," said Tom.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Think Tom Holland Is 'The One' For Zendaya</a></span></p><p>The actor is willing to go the extra mile to ensure he can also watch the show live. For example, Tom told reporters that while he was shooting in Spain, he downloaded a VPN to ensure he could watch that week's episode. "It still didn't work, so I haven't seen episode 5, but I've heard it's incredible," Holland shared with reporters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-tom-holland-already-make-a-guest-appearance-on-euphoria>Did Tom Holland Already Make A Guest Appearance On Euphoria?</h2><p>Fans believe that Tom has secretly appeared in an episode of Euphoria already. The theory went viral on TikTok <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">when a user posted a video of what looks to be a silhouette of Tom watching Lexi's famous play</a> during season two, episode seven. The video has millions of views, with the comment section littered with fans dissecting the possibility of it genuinely being Zendaya's boyfriend.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Zendaya And Tom Holland Buy A Secret Home In South London?</a></span></p><p>Pairing this video with Tom admitting that he visited the set at least 30 times during the season, fans are convinced that the actor has been featured secretly on the show. However, the video on TikTok is edited to include an apparent frame of Tom. There's also yet to be confirmation from Tom, Zendaya, or the Euphoria production team that the Marvel star can be spotted among the crowd.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Entertainment Tonight asked<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the Emmy award-winning actress about the possible cameo from her boyfriend</a>, she responded with a playful "who knows, the world may never know." We know that Tom vocalized his intentions of being on the show more than once. "Listen, I have been petitioning for this for a long time, and it has not happened yet and I'm very disappointed," said Tom during a 2021 IMDB interview.</p><p>Even other stars from the show are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">calling for Tom's inclusion</a>. During an interview with IMDB, Sydney Sweeney said, "I really feel like we just need Spider-Man to come in and save the day." Maude Apatow added that it could be a Euphoria meets the Marvel Cinematic Universe moment. Zendaya was present for the conversations, laughing and adding in response, "I don't know how Disney would feel about that, but yeah!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-does-tom-holland-help-zendaya-prepare-for-filming-euphoria>How Does Tom Holland Help Zendaya Prepare For Filming Euphoria?</h2><p>Season two of Euphoria brought around a lot of challenges for Zendaya. Her character, Rue, faced some incredibly intense moments - leaving the actress physically and emotionally scarred. Fans and critics alike have commended Zendaya for her incredibly real and heartbreaking performance. She's expected to be nominated for an Emmy for the role, which she won an Emmy for in 2020.</p><p>Zendaya hasn't been shy about admitting <a href=#>how pivotal Tom has been in her journey to perfecting the performance</a>. During a 2021 interview with Elle Australia, she revealed that playing the role of Rue takes a real toll on the actress. Throughout season two, she was thankful to have the love and support of Tom. Having Tom around allowed her to detach from the heaviness of her role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor was catapulted into international fame and accredited Zendaya with helping him transition from an everyday human to a superstar. During an interview with the Associated Press, the actor emphasized how important his companionship with Zendaya has been throughout the filming of the Spider-Man movies. Tom has also acknowledged how much Zendaya supports him through times of strife.</p><p>"Two friends coming together, experiencing this world, going through the same problems at the same time, having a shoulder to cry on, has been a huge thing for the pair of us," said Tom. "There's not a corner of the world that Spider-Man hasn't touched. It's a lot to take in, so it's really nice for me to have a family to share that with." Moments before, he took a moment to acknowledge how beautiful Zendaya looked as she walked onto the carpet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Although Zendaya's mom seemingly squashed recent engagement rumors about them</a>, Zendaya and Tom are going strong. The couple seems to have a steady foundation of trust, respect, and friendship to ensure their relationship withstands the tests of celebrity. Season three of Euphoria has been ordered by HBO, but it's yet to head into production. Fingers crossed that some of Tom's trips to set next season are dedicated to an appearance in the drama series, once and for all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGwsdJmq6ilXZ28rbjAp5tmrJieu6x5wJumrqxdr7KvsMCymGahnmKytrzHqKmimV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-costumbres-by-banda-el-recodo-de-cruz-lizarraga.html><span>←</span><span>The Meaning Behind The Song: Costumbres by Banda El Recodo de Cruz Lizrraga</span></a>
