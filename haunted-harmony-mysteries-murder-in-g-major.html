Elated at the opportunity to teach music at St. Brendan’s boarding school in the beautiful country of Ireland, the former orchestra conductor packs her bag and embarks upon the journey seeking a new adventure. To save money, she accepts the opportunity to house-sit in a charming cottage in the countryside. However, aside from the lush green fields of the Emerald Isle, Gethsemane is greeted by the friendly ghost of a renowned composer named Eamon McCarthy via a cryptic musical message she deciphers as “dead.”</p><p>After the initial shock of living in a <a href=#>haunted house</a> wears off, Gethsemane agrees to help Eamon solve the mystery behind his and his lover’s murders so that his spirit is able to move on from the physical world and reunite with his love. Eamon was falsely accused of the murder of his partner, so Gethsemane dons her sleuthing glasses and sets out to investigate the murders and find the actual perpetrator. Gethsemane struggles to strike a balance between crime-solving and prepping a riotous crew of students to become an organized choir to compete in the Regionals. Apart from the interesting premise, we are sure you must be enamored by the picturesque setting and wondering where the movie was filmed.</p><h2>Haunted Harmony Mysteries: Murder in G Major Filming Locations</h2><p>‘Haunted Harmony Mysteries: Murder in G Major’ was filmed in its entirety in Ireland, primarily in Wicklow and Meath counties. Principal photography for the mystery film seemingly got underway in late March 2023 and wrapped up in about three weeks, in April of the same year.
