Once immobilizers were added to the cars, Moore said, vehicle thefts of Kias and Hyundais “plunged.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/newspress-collage-25555347-1675056410989.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/fdvfdvd.png><p>The report also notes that immobilizers were standard in 26 percent of Kia and Hyundai vehicle models in 2015, but standard in 96 percent of all other manufacturers.</p><p>State Farm and Progressive did not immediately respond to inquiries seeking additional information about the claims.</p><p>In a statement to CNN, State Farm confirmed the temporary halting of writing insurance policies in some states for some Kia and Hyundai model years and trim levels.</p><p>Progressive also confirmed with CNN that it was making changes. In some areas, Progressive is increasing rates and limiting the sale of new insurance policies for those who have Kias and Hyundais that fit within the slot of vehicles that are at substantial risk.</p><p><a href=#>Kia and Hyundai vehicle thefts</a> are up as much as 300% over the past two years in some cities.</p><p>Videos posted on social media show people how to start the vehicles without keys, with the tip of a phone charger or USB cable, and the trend has prompted juveniles across the US to try to <a href=#>steal Kia and Hyundai vehicles to go for a joyride</a>.</p><p>The manufacturers are working through the thefts, with Hyundai offering steering wheel locks through municipalities like Clearwater, Florida.&nbsp;</p><p>Another fix making the rounds was created by the Suntrup Automotive Group in St. Louis, Missouri, involving a redesigned off-the-shelf Bluetooth switch that could be hardwired to the car to immobilize the ignition.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2pmbGhfoq6ru9FmoKerpaeys7%2BMqaOapl2pvG6w0ainZqynpHqkrdFmpKiclaHAbq%2FOr5yrmZeaeqXBxGarqGWknbKnwNJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-petras-talks-halloween-album-dating-and-nudity.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Petras Talks Halloween Album, Dating and Nudity</span></a>
