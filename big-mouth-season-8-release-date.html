Both the good and the bad news are that Big Mouth has been picked up for an eighth season. It has now been officially announced that this will be the final season of the cartoon.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Season 7 was announced in April of this year, and its release date has been set for 2024. There is currently no news regarding the premiere of the last season, but fans can be assured that they will not be disappointed.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Big Mouth will be the longest scripted series in Netflix history (excluding kids’ and family shows) when it concludes on a high note with season 8. Previously, the title was held by series like Grace & Frankie, and Orange Is the New Black, both of which aired for a total of seven seasons.</p><p style=text-align:justify>According to Billy Wee, Netflix’s director of adult animation, “Big Mouth is a towering achievement in animated comedy that will make Netflix history for its longevity,” following the news that season 8 will be the series’ last.</p><p style=text-align:justify>As the creators put it, “We are thrilled that we still have two more hilarious seasons to share with fans before this brilliant coming-of-age story reaches its conclusion.” This concludes our coverage of the eighth season of Big Mouth.</p><h2 id=is-there-a-big-mouth-season-8-release-date class=rb-heading-index-0>Is there a Big Mouth Season 8 release date?</h2><p style=text-align:justify><strong>The release date for Season 8 of Big Mouth is set for 2024.</strong></p><p style=text-align:justify>Big Mouth was picked up for a final season eight months before the seventh season’s debut in April 2023. “If you would have told adolescent Nick Kroll and Andrew Goldberg that middle school would take eight years to finish, they would have been like, ‘Yeah, that sounds about right. This seems like it will never end,’” &nbsp;Kroll added.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>EXCLUSIVE: Ahead of ‘Big Mouth’s Season 7 premiere, Netflix has renewed the Emmy-winning adult animated comedy series for a milestone eighth season, which will be its last <a href=#>https://t.co/0zvJXbnp1l</a></p><p>— Deadline Hollywood (@DEADLINE) <a href=# rel=noopener>April 24, 2023</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Human Resources, a spin-off of Big Mouth, will similarly be canceled after its second season (which debuted on June 9, 2023). With the exception of part 1 of season 3, Big Mouth has always premiered at the end of the year.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Big Mouth Season 8 is expected to premiere in late 2024, barring any delays caused by the present SAG-AFTRA strike. Based on the data we have at hand, we have come up with this estimated date.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Nick Kroll lends his voice to a wide variety of characters, including Nick Birch, Maurice the Hormone Monster, Coach Steve, Rick the Hormone Monster, Lola Skumpy, Nick Starr, a webcam lady, Gina’s Abuela, Bad Mitten, and Rabbi Poblart.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Big Mouth, Nick Kroll’s popular adult animated comedy series, is coming to an end next year with Season 8, Netflix announced ahead of the premiere of the show’s seventh season. <a href=#>https://t.co/WstuXXvCVC</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/6FL22fWjuD</a></p><p>— IGN (@IGN) <a href=# rel=noopener>April 25, 2023</a></p><h2 id=big-mouth8217s-season-8-story class=rb-heading-index-1>Big Mouth’s Season 8 Story</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Big Mouth has chronicled a group of friends going through puberty for a number of seasons, showing how difficult and confusing it can be. Their childhood inspired the show’s creators, Nick Kroll and Andrew Goldberg, in New York suburbia.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The series has been praised for its exploration of themes of adolescence, s*xuality, racism, and more. Season 8 will likely follow a similar pattern. Though specifics of the last season are being kept under wraps for the time being, fans can anticipate more of the same mayhem and adventures associated with coming of age.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The seventh season focused on the group as mature adolescents adjusting to high school and all the ups and downs that entails in terms of peer acceptance, romantic interests, and other such topics.</p><p>The summary states that “Change is the only constant as each character is faced with a new school, new friends, new adversaries, and new Hormone Monsters.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>Is season 8 going to see our gang of buddies finally mature enough to take on higher education? We’ll have to wait and see what happens.</p><h2 id=is-there-a-season-8-trailer-for-big-mouth class=rb-heading-index-2>Is there a season 8 trailer for Big Mouth?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>In the meantime, no.
