Two belts, actually.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> RT</a> reports that he wants one to commemorate his third battle against Dustin Poirier this summer, and he wants another one created which he has termed as: "The Richest MotherF****r Belt." McGregor, who is worth $130 million, would be the undisputed winner, by default.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Most Expensive Things Conor McGregor Has Bought</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>McGregor has been awarded top honors in the ring&nbsp; more than a few times in his career, but his last match up was one that reflected a very bitter defeat. Known to be a very vocal competitor, McGregor spent a good deal of time letting the world know that his second match up with Poirier wasn't going to end well for his opponent. Seemingly confident and ready to face his rival, McGregor soon realized this fight wasn't going to end quite the way he expected.</p><p>Poirier ended up winning by total knock out, and it seems McGregor's ego was as damaged as the rest of his body was during that fight. Defeated and dismayed, McGregor moved on and the 3rd match-up, but he's approaching this fight with a new twist. The request for belts to be created in his honor suggest that perhaps he's not confident he will win one on his own.</p><p>McGregor is well aware of the fact that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his wealth far exceeds that of any other UFC fighter, </a>and he's smearing that in the face of Poirier with this new, brazen request for two custom belts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Well aware of the fact that he's the prized fighter for the UFC due to his economic power and value to the organization, McGregor's confidence rose to the surface. He took to social media to say;&nbsp;"I ask the UFC to please create The McGregor belt. I suggest rose gold and rubies. Think patek rare." He then went on to say; "Let’s do two belts actually. Champ Champ always does two. We’ve got ‘The McGregor Belt’ currently in creation, and now we’ve got the all new ‘RMF’ belt. ‘The Richest Motherf*cker Belt’. This way we can put both the rubies and emeralds to good use.”</p><p>Many believe this to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">arrogance at its finest,</a> while others perceive this as a teaser and income-generating hook to tease the next fight.</p><p>The UFC has not responded to his requests.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Highest UFC Pay Days In History</a></span></p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RT</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSwsLrOq2Smm5ensqi70Wasn5tdp7aktMSsq2abmJa6sbXOp6qhoaBk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ann-pugh-obituary-funeral-details-and-visitation-family-mourns.html><span>←</span><span>Ann Pugh Obituary, Funeral Details And Visitation, Family Mourns</span></a>
