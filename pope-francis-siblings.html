in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and went on to become the 266th Pope of the Roman Catholic Church.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Controversies></span>Controversies<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pope Francis has been embroiled in several controversies during his papacy, reflecting a divide within the Catholic Church.</p><p>One significant controversy revolves around his decision to authorize priests to bless homosexual couples under certain conditions, which has faced strong opposition from conservative factions within the Vatican.</p><p>This move, seen as a departure from traditional Catholic doctrine, has intensified the conflict between those advocating for a more modern and inclusive approach and those upholding conservative views on issues like the status of homosexual couples and divorced individuals in the Church.</p><p>Another controversy involved Pope Francis’ remarks on LGBTQ issues, where he famously stated, “Who am I to judge?” regarding gay individuals seeking the Lord.</p><p>This statement, hailed by LGBTQ advocates, marked a shift in the Church’s tone towards acceptance.</p><p>However, his stance on issues like gay marriage and the ordination of women has sparked criticism and debate within the Church, highlighting the ongoing tension between progressive and conservative factions.</p><p>Additionally, Pope Francis faced backlash for his comments on the existence of hell, accusations of sex abuse victims being slanderers and his involvement in political debates, particularly on issues like economics, migration policy and climate change.</p><p>These controversies have underscored the ideological clash within the Church and the challenges of balancing traditional doctrine with a more progressive and inclusive approach under his leadership.</p><b>Email your news TIPS to Editor@kahawatungu.com or WhatsApp +254707482874</b><p class=postsid
