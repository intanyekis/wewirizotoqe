Manson vehemently denied these allegations.</p><p>An insider close to Manson, real name Brian Warner, refuted Wood’s claims, criticized Wood for publicly making unverified allegations, and highlighted safety concerns for Manson and his wife Lindsay Usich due to alleged threats made by Wood’s girlfriend, Illma Gore. The part of the lawsuit involving the letter was eventually dismissed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Singer-Marilyn-Manson-hits-back-at-actress-Evan-Rachel-Woods.jpg><p>There have been numerous accusations of sexual abuse and human trafficking directed at Manson. Despite over a dozen women, including Wood, alleging abuse, Manson has consistently denied these claims.</p><p>The source stated, “Brian Warner has not had any contact nor communications of any kind with Evan Rachel Wood in nearly a decade. At no time has Brian Warner ever threatened Ms. Wood or her family.” The source further asserted that Wood has not provided any evidence of Warner making threats and criticized the credibility of her story.</p><p>In November 2022, Manson filed a defamation lawsuit against Wood and Gore for what he deemed as malicious and false sexual abuse accusations. Wood has claimed that Manson manipulated and groomed her during her teenage years.</p><p>Manson’s attorney alleged that Gore had used a forged FBI letter to solicit false claims against Manson. On the other hand, Gore denied Manson’s accusations and clarified that she was reaching out to his exes and women who had experienced domestic violence for an HBO documentary.</p><p>In his lawsuit, Manson asserted that Wood and Gore impersonated an FBI agent to distribute the letter and recruit others to make false accusations against him. The lawsuit also accused Gore of hacking Manson’s personal accounts.</p><p>Despite Manson’s legal action, a Los Angeles Superior Court Judge dismissed certain parts of the lawsuit, citing California laws protecting free speech rights. Wood’s attorney welcomed the ruling, emphasizing the protection of Wood’s First Amendment rights, while Manson’s attorney expressed disappointment and indicated plans for an immediate appeal.</p><p>Currently residing in Nashville, Tennessee, Wood has been fighting to keep her son out of Los Angeles, where Manson also resides.</p><p>In a recent filing, Wood and Bell have agreed that their son will primarily live with Bell in Los Angeles, with Wood having custody of Jack for an extended weekend every month and holidays like Spring Break.</p><p>Bell had previously claimed that Wood began preventing him from seeing his son, which she denied, stressing her concerns about the safety of herself and her son if they were to reside in Los Angeles.</p><p>The new custody arrangement has been signed and filed with the LA County Courts.</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmipnqugpLu0sYyfqailXai2r7PEq2SmmaKeubq6jKaYp6ufo3q1u4yamq2qlajAbrHVmqVmqpGYtaa4jLCmqJyjYrCtrcimqmaZkqTCtXnToamemaSau6q6xmafnqpdqLyvew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./one-life-to-live-cast-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>One Life to Live Cast Net Worth Richest Cast Members Salary</span></a>
