Iron Hands Raid Build The Talks Today</h1></header><section class=post-content><h2 id=how_to_get_iron_hands_in_pokemon_scarlet_and_violet class=smooth-goto>How to Get Iron Hands in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet?</h2><p>Iron Hands is a rare Pokemon that can typically be found in the cliff zones surrounding Research Stations 1, 2, and 3 in The Great Crater of Paldea (Area Zero). However, it’s important to note that you can only access this location after clearing all three story paths. It’s worth mentioning that Iron Hands is exclusive to Pokemon Violet, so if you’re playing Pokemon Scarlet, you won’t be able to obtain it directly. In such a case, you can trade with friends who play Pokemon Violet in order to acquire this rare Pokemon. Additionally, players need to keep in mind that Iron Hands is a rare Pokemon and may not be encountered easily. Its appearance rate is relatively low, so it might take some time and effort to catch it. Once caught, Iron Hands can prove to be a valuable addition to your Pokemon team with its unique abilities and strengths. It is recommended to stock up on Ultra Balls or other high-level Pokeballs to increase your chances of catching this rare Pokemon.</p><h2 id=iron_hands_moveset class=smooth-goto>Iron Hands Moveset</h2><table cellspacing=0><tbody><tr><td><strong>Move</strong></td><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td><strong>Category</strong></td><td><strong>Power</strong></td><td><strong>Accuracy</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Arm Thrust</td><td>FIGHTING</td><td>Physical</td><td>15</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Focus Energy</td><td>NORMAL</td><td>Status</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Sand Attack</td><td>GROUND</td><td>Status</td><td>—</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Tackle</td><td>NORMAL</td><td>Physical</td><td>40</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Fake Out</td><td>NORMAL</td><td>Physical</td><td>40</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Whirlwind</td><td>NORMAL</td><td>Status</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Thunder Punch</td><td>ELECTRIC</td><td>Physical</td><td>75</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Slam</td><td>NORMAL</td><td>Physical</td><td>80</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>Force Palm</td><td>FIGHTING</td><td>Physical</td><td>60</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Seismic Toss</td><td>FIGHTING</td><td>Physical</td><td>—</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Charge</td><td>ELECTRIC</td><td>Status</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Wild Charge</td><td>ELECTRIC</td><td>Physical</td><td>90</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Close Combat</td><td>FIGHTING</td><td>Physical</td><td>120</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Detect</td><td>FIGHTING</td><td>Status</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy Slam</td><td>STEEL</td><td>Physical</td><td>—</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Belly Drum</td><td>NORMAL</td><td>Status</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Focus Punch</td><td>FIGHTING</td><td>Physical</td><td>150</td><td>100</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=iron_hands_raid_build class=smooth-goto>Iron Hands Raid Build</h2><p>The Iron Hands Pokemon is a great choice for raid battles in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, especially when using the Belly Drum attack and combining it with the Drain Punch move for high damage and health regeneration. The best Raid Build for Iron Hands requires it to have the Belly Drum move, which maximizes the attack stat by cutting the user’s HP in half, and the Drain Punch move, which restores health equal to half the damage inflicted. The remaining two moves can be customized based on preference and the opponent’s weaknesses. To optimize Iron Hands’ effectiveness, players can purchase the Punching Glove held item from Zapapico, and use the Montenevera Hyper Training to boost all of its stats except Sp. Atk and Speed, and use Vitamins and feathers to boost attack and all defensive EV stats. Additionally, players can use the Adamant Mint to ensure that Iron Hands has the Adamant nature, which raises attack and lowers Sp. Atk. Once set up with the Raid Build, players can use Belly Drum to maximize the attack stat and then use Drain Punch to deal damage and restore lost health. During the raid battle, players should keep using Drain Punch or another attack until the Raid Pokemon negates all stat changes for the team. If at full health with the Belly Drum attack bonus active, players can use Close Combat for even more damage. Iron Hands is obtainable in Pokemon Violet after completing all three plot lines and accessing Area Zero in the Great Crater of Paldea. Unfortunately, there is no Belly Drum TM available in-game, making Iron Hands one of the few Pokemon that can learn the move organically through leveling.</p><h2 id=where_to_find_iron_hands_in_pokemon_scarlet class=smooth-goto>Where to find Iron Hands in Pokemon Scarlet?</h2><p>Iron Hands is a Paradox Pokemon that can only be found in Pokemon Violet in The Great Crater of Paldea’s cliff zones around Research Stations 1, 2, and 3. However, the location is only accessible once you clear all three story paths. It’s important to note that Iron Hands is not available in Pokemon Scarlet, so players of this version will need to trade with friends who play Pokemon Violet to obtain it. Paradox Pokemon are a new addition to the Generation 9 Pokemon in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, and they have themes related to the past and future. Iron Hands is a unique Pokemon that resembles Hariyama but does not evolve from it. Its exclusive location and distinct characteristics make it a desirable Pokemon for players who want to build powerful Raid teams.</p><p><i>Disclaimer</i>: The above information is for general informational purposes only.
