The Truth Behind the Rumors</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Kesha, the pop star who rose to fame with hits like “Tik Tok” and “Die Young”, has been the subject of many rumors and speculations about her health, career, and personal life. Some fans have even wondered if she is still alive, after a series of legal battles, health issues, and media controversies. In this article, we will explore the facts and the fiction behind the question: is Kesha still alive?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kesha’s Legal Struggle with Dr. Luke</h2><p>One of the most prominent and publicized events in Kesha’s life was her lawsuit against her former producer and label owner, Dr. Luke. Kesha accused him of sexually, physically, and emotionally abusing her for over a decade, and sought to be released from her contract with him. Dr. Luke denied the allegations and countersued Kesha for defamation and breach of contract.</p><p>The legal dispute lasted for several years, and had a significant impact on Kesha’s career and mental health. She was unable to release new music under her own name, and faced a lot of backlash and criticism from some fans and industry insiders. She also suffered from depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, and checked into a rehab facility in 2014 to treat her eating disorder.</p><p>The case was eventually settled out of court in June 2023, after a New York judge dismissed most of Kesha’s claims and ruled that she had defamed Dr. Luke. Kesha agreed to pay him $1.3 million in damages, and to drop all remaining charges against him. She also regained full control over her music and career, and was free to work with other producers and labels.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kesha’s Health Diagnosis and Recovery</h2><p>Another major challenge that Kesha faced was her diagnosis with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), a rare disorder that affects the immune system and makes it difficult to fight off infections. Kesha revealed that she had CVID in an interview with Rolling Stone in 2022, and explained how it affected her life and health.</p><p>Kesha said that she had been suffering from chronic fatigue, joint pain, and frequent illnesses for years, but did not know the cause until she underwent a series of tests. She said that she had to take medication and injections regularly, and that she had to be careful about her exposure to germs and viruses. She also said that she had to cancel some of her shows and appearances due to her condition.</p><p>In light of her diagnosis and recovery, Kesha also revealed that she “almost died” in January 2023, after she froze her eggs and suffered complications as a result of her weakened immune system. She said that she had to undergo emergency surgery, and that she was in a coma for two days. She said that she was grateful to be alive, and that she wanted to have children someday.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kesha’s Career and Life Updates</h2><p>Despite the hardships and obstacles that Kesha faced, she did not give up on her passion and dreams. She continued to make music and express herself through her art. She released her fifth studio album, Gag Order, in May 2023, which was a critical and commercial success. The album featured collaborations with artists like Sia, Lizzo, and Lil Nas X, and showcased Kesha’s versatility and creativity. The album also addressed some of the themes and issues that Kesha had experienced, such as trauma, healing, empowerment, and freedom.</p><p>Kesha also embarked on a world tour to promote her album, and performed at various festivals and events. She received positive reviews and praise from fans and critics alike, and proved that she was still a force to be reckoned with in the music industry. She also received several awards and nominations, including a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album.</p><p>Kesha also opened up about her personal life and relationships, and shared some of the joys and challenges that she faced. She said that she was dating a new boyfriend, who was supportive and understanding of her situation. She also said that she was close to her family and friends, and that they helped her through her difficult times. She also said that she was happy and healthy, and that she was looking forward to the future.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Conclusion</h2><p>So, is Kesha still alive? The answer is a resounding yes. Kesha is not only alive, but thriving. She has overcome many adversities and obstacles, and has emerged stronger and wiser. She has also continued to make music and art, and to inspire and entertain millions of fans around the world. Kesha is a survivor, a fighter, and a star.
