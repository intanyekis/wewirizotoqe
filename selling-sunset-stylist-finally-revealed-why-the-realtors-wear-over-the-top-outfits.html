Chrishell Stause is in another feud. This time, with Nicole Young. Even <strong><a href=#>Nick Cannon</a></strong>'s baby mama Bre Tiesi got into a fight with <a href=#>Chelsea Lazkani — "ally" of Christine Quinn</a>, former cast member and "<a href=#>the show's mean girl</a>."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking of Quinn, she's one of the stars that really set the tone for impractical fashion in the Oppenheim Group. From expensive couture to chair purses that don't really hold anything, the realtor never held back when it comes to all things style.</p><p>Even now that she's left, the rest of the realtors still show out with their fancy outfits like Lazkani's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">impossible-to-sit-on, belt mini skirt</a>. That scene has now gone viral online, and fans can't help but wonder how these realtors do their jobs in such restrictive garments.</p><p>Recently, a stylist on Selling Sunset set the record straight on why the cast always seems to be in bra tops and Met Gala-level work clothes. Here's the truth behind the show's glam choices, as well as its budget.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Heather Rae Young Lose A Fortune After Not Being Featured In Selling Sunset Season 7?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-pays-for-selling-sunset-39-s-glam-amp-wardrobe>Who Pays For Selling Sunset's Glam & Wardrobe?</h2><p>In a recent TikTok Q&A, fans asked Lazkani if the show pays for their glam and wardrobe. "Do we get a wardrobe budget? Do we have stylists? Does anyone pay for our clothes? Do we get glam for filming? We get this question a lot," she said in the clip, before stating: "We do not get a wardrobe or glam budget."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fw7r9wmwaaapyty.jpeg><p>She added that "this is very standard in reality TV," explaining that "this is reality TV, you come as you please. On Selling Sunset, we definitely turn up for y'all. We turn it up, we are definitely glam girls, we love to be in glam, we love to bring the fashion." That's why they pay for their own glam team.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It is out of our own pocket. No wardrobe budget, no one pays for our glam, nobody pays for our outfits," she reiterated. She then joked: "That's why if you see me looking crazy, it’s my fault and my fault only." Quinn previously revealed that she'd spend $1,000 a day on her hair and makeup alone.</p><p>"When it comes to the show, I don't do my own hair. I do my own makeup because I love doing it," she said. "The full start to finish, including wardrobe, is around two and a half to three hours. My glam isn't cheap, either — $1,000 a day, if I go all out. It's expensive to look this cheap." It sure is.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Fans Are Concerned About Mary Fitzgerald's Mental Health In Selling Sunset Season 6</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-is-the-selling-sunset-cast-always-wearing-over-the-top-outfits>Why Is The Selling Sunset Cast Always Wearing Over-The-Top Outfits?</h2><p>Recently, LA-based stylist <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sammie M told Vice</a> about what goes on behind the scenes of the show. He works with Mary Fitzgerald and Amanza Smith, as well as the other realtors if they're in a "fashion emergency." He said that "they're all like, in competition," hence the over-the-top outfits.</p><p>"Basically, all the girls are out for themselves, and they're just trying to step it up because now, the way social media is, you have to step it up," he said of the girls' social media-driven style choices. He even shared that another cast member had reached out to him for his services for future seasons because she wants to "take it up a notch."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/selling-sunset-season-6.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It's becoming a show where everybody watches the clothes, pretty much," he explained. "Some people now, instead of watching for the houses, they're watching for the fashion." Sammie noted that there's a lot of business behind these outfits.</p><p>"Ever since I started [on Selling Sunset], Instagram meme pages and closets have reached out to me asking 'What season is this outfit that they're wearing? Where is it from?' so they can add it to their Instagram post," he said.</p><p>"I put Amanza in Ivy Park and Adidas reached out asking to send me more stuff for the show." He added that "the girls want to coordinate their look with the type of brands they want to work with, because brands will pay a client $20-30,000 to post one Instagram in one of their outfits to generate sales."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/selling-sunset-season-6-cast.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for the budget, he also confirmed that the stars spend their own money when it comes to glam and wardrobe. "I'm not going to name names," Sammie said, "but some girls will pay between $5,000 to $10,000 for a custom-made outfit. Sometimes more. But we're in Hollywood, and there's a lot of access to rentals."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Selling Sunset Fans Are Siding With Bre Tiesi Amid Feud With Chelsea Lazkani Over Her Relationship With Nick Cannon</a></span></p><p>When asked about the bright, neon clothes, Sammie said: "I'm not going to lie. They do dress like that. People in LA are very colorful, very fashionable. It’s bright, you’re living in the sun. It's like that. And they're selling these million-dollar homes, working with celebrity clients, TV personalities, people working in fashion."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"So it is over the top, but still very much into what they're characterizing on the show." Regarding the sequin bras, he just said, "Well, LA is hot."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqnqScnruoedKupaydpGLAtcXLoqqtZZaeu6K4y7Jkq52mmq6tscNmrqGxXam1pnnRnpilrJ%2BnwG7DxJqpZqemmr9uwMeeZK2noGK8tsDFoqusZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ron-perlman-family-where-are-they-from-ethnicity-wife-and-kids.html><span>←</span><span>Ron Perlman Family Where Are They From?
