It’s been over six years since that happened, so people have understandably wondered what’s happened with Soules.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/4997347e26c058e95a2f697fbdda3993.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Chris Soules hugging Wells Adams on September 23, 2016 in Las Vegas, Nevada | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>SHORT-LIVED RELATIONSHIP</strong></p><p class=dh>Shortly after “The Bachelor,” Chris Soules became a contestant of “Dancing with the Stars” season 20. He was paired with professional dancer Witney Carson and made it to week 8, finishing fifth.</p><p class=dh>During his time on the show, Bischoff regularly appeared in the audience rooting for her fiancé. Unfortunately, their romance didn’t stand the test of time.</p><p class=dh>Chris Soules and Whitney Bischoff announced that they had “mutually and amicably” ended their six-month engagement in May 2015, only two months after “The Bachelor” aired its final episode.</p><p class=dh>The former couple pointed out that, while they would no longer be together, they felt respect and admiration for one another and would <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.eonline.com/news/845932/chris-soules-isolated-world-after-the-bachelor-when-reality-tv-stardom-doesn-t-do-much-but-crank-up-the-spotlight>keep their friendship</a>.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>PROBLEMS WITH THE LAW</strong></p><p class=dh>Soules’ life took a turn for the worse in April 2017 after being arrested for leaving the scene of a deadly car crash in Iowa. Soules and 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher were involved in an accident in a rural part of Iowa close to Soules’ home.</p><p class=dh>According to the Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office, Soules was driving a pickup truck that rear-ended the tractor Mosher was driving. Officers found <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.eonline.com/news/845932/chris-soules-isolated-world-after-the-bachelor-when-reality-tv-stardom-doesn-t-do-much-but-crank-up-the-spotlight>alcohol containers</a> in Soules’ vehicle.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>He didn’t [call an attorney] because he had “nothing to hide.”</strong></h3><p class=dh>It is important to add that Soules had some past driving infractions that included a DUI arrest, six citations for speeding, and other parking tickets.</p><p class=dh>In August 2019, over two years after the accident took place, the “Bachelor” alum accepted a suspended <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/bachelor-chris-soules-car-crash-2-year-suspended-prison-term/>two-year prison sentence</a>. He was also requested to serve two years of probation.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>OPENING UP ABOUT THE ACCIDENT</strong></p><p class=dh>One month after Chris Soules’ accident case was settled, he admitted he couldn’t describe the trauma that came with the situation. The TV personality admitted he thought about the crash every day. Soules <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/bachelor-chris-soules-opens-up-involvement-fatal-accident-2017/>added</a>:</p><p class=dh>“There is not a day that goes by that I don’t wish I could have done more or change the outcome of what happened.”</p><p class=dh>During an interview with “Good Morning America,” Soules explained he was on the road to pick up one of his workers when the accident happened. In the blink of an eye, all he knew was that “something bad” happened and that <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.eonline.com/news/1074656/former-bachelor-chris-soules-addresses-why-he-left-the-scene-of-fatal-car-crash>he needed help</a>.</p><p class=dh>After the paramedics arrived, Soules, who confessed he was not thinking “clearly,” left home as he wanted to be in a safer place. He pointed out that he notified the authorities of the situation, though.</p><p class=dh>Once he was home, he called his parents and told them about the accident. They wanted him to contact an attorney, but he didn’t because he had “<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://youtu.be/Fjj93Y9sw2s>nothing to hide</a>.”</p><p class=dh>Chris Soules also said he had not been drinking that night, adding that the truck he was driving belonged to one of the “over 15 people” that worked for him at the time.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>DATING LIFE</strong></p><p class=dh>In the two years following the accident, Soules was single, so all the support he received came only from close friends and family members. In mid-2020, he and former “<a class="me a" href=#>The Bachelor</a>” contestant <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/how-did-victoria-fuller-and-chris-soules-meet-bachelor-stars-dating/>Victoria Fuller</a> sparked relationship rumors.</p><p class=dh>The couple got in touch through a mutual friend. Soules texted her in March 2020, but they only met in person in early April. While they were both nervous, it wasn’t awkward but “<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/bachelor-victoria-fuller-so-happy-dating-chris-soules/>natural</a>.”</p><p class=dh>That September, Fuller announced they were no longer together. Two months later, though, Chris Soules said they were still working on their relationship, adding he just <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/chris-soules-is-working-on-his-relationship-with-victoria-fuller/>wanted to be a farmer</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmttbW9mbnqktNGiqmarn6q5pr%2BMpaCfnV2XrqS0xKWmq2WWp7yuecuenpqkXam%2Fb7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-holt-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Holt Net Worth</span></a>
