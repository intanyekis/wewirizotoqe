But that same year spin-off series <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Counting On</a>, which follows the Duggar children as they start having their own families, have kept the Duggar family in the reality television show business and had them earning big dollars having their lives on display for everyone to see.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So far, there have been 10 seasons of Counting On, which heavily features Jessa Duggar and Ben Seewald, who together have three children; two sons and a daughter. Jessa was the fifth child of Duggar parents Jim-Bob and Michelle, and is one of their eight children who are married.</p><p>While the show features many of the Duggar children, Jessa and Ben are perhaps two of the most heavily featured and can be considered the ‘stars’ of the show. It has helped them build a pretty good net worth from the reality show.</p><h2 id=jessa-and-ben-getting-their-piece><strong>Jessa And Ben Getting Their Piece</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since 2015, it’s been estimated the show has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">helped earn the kids over $1.2 million</a>, and Jessa and Ben have been large benefactors of that, as they have a net worth of over $400,000. The downfall of having so many kids is that, the pie has to be split amongst them all, and as more Duggar children get married and start having kids, and start getting featured on the show, the more that money per season has to be divided amongst themselves.</p><p>However, considering it is reported that both Jessa and Ben don’t have jobs, except for being reality television stars, having a net worth of over $400,000 isn’t necessarily a bad thing for them. Ben hasn’t worked in a long time, despite having a political science degree, and mostly helps out Jim-bob, while his wife remains thrifty in buying cheap clothing. Considering the family lives in Arkansas, where the average salary is just $35,000, they are doing pretty well for themselves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jessa-earning-in-other-ways><strong>Jessa Earning In Other Ways</strong></h2><p>While the television show continues to bring in dollars for the family, social media has opened up a whole new revenue generator avenue for the Duggar children, as many of them have taken to social media services like Instagram and YouTube and have become influencers.</p><p>Jessa Duggar is heavily popular on Instagram and has over 2.2 million followers, posting everything from family pictures to recipes to hair tutorials. That’s a hefty following for the mother of three, who is using it to sell products, like clothing, to her fans. But that isn’t the only social media platform she is on, as she took to YouTube with her own channel, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">which continues to build her brand</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the latest videos was about hospitality and wanting to invite more people over to her home in the hopes of creating a sense of community. It’s the type of content you would expect from a Duggar, as they continue to portray the image of a loving family that just wants to grow a massive happy community. But Jessa is smart about selecting YouTube as a platform, because unlike Instagram, YouTube has sponsored ad content, which allows Jessa to make money from her videos, without needing sponsors to give her money directly.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">16 Pics That Reveal Who The REAL Jinger Duggar Is</a></span></p><h2 id=how-much-can-she-make-from-social-media><strong>How Much Can She Make&nbsp;</strong><strong>From Social Media?</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With Jessa’s channels picking up in popularity, the revenue is increasing. According to Social Blade, earnings could be anywhere from $5,000 to $60,000 a year, depending on how popular her channel becomes. At the highest, that’s nearly twice as much as a person makes in Arkansas, just by posting videos to YouTube and images to Instagram.</p><p>Oddly, Jessa seems to be the only Duggar who is using YouTube as a tool to earn, and most of the kids have stuck to Instagram as their method of talking to fans and posting updates and videos. The Duggar Family Instagram account only has 1.3 million followers, while sister <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jinger</a> has 1.3 million followers, and Jill has 1.6 million, making Jessa the leader in social media followers.</p><p>While Jessa’s YouTube channel has only 105,000 subscribers, it’s a work in progress, as she continues to upload videos nearly every single day. Her channel has over 7.4 million views, and it’s gaining in popularity, which will push the net worth of the Seewald family even further, especially if the ad revenue starts to pick up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Must-See Photos From Joe & Kendra Duggar's Instagram</a></span></p><h2 id=social-media-controversy-with-fans><strong>Social Media Controversy With Fans</strong></h2><p>However, her social media posting has brought up some issues with fans. Many fans have pointed out that Jessa pushes this thrifty lifestyle, where her younger children get hand-me-downs from the older children, but it’s because the Seewald’s don’t want to go and get actual jobs.</p><p>Reddit posts have gone into massive discussions about this, with one fan saying, “I’m not willing to give Jessa too much credit for dressing Ivy in her older brothers’ clothes, when the reason may well be that she and [Ben] don’t have (or apparently want) jobs.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, while sharing their lives on social media has helped them at the bank, it definitely hasn’t left them out of the arena of controversy.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Will Happen To The Duggars' Counting On If Jill And Derick Dillard Move Oversears?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaqK2eqbavs4yopWagn6x6rsHCoWSaqpVit6a%2F0ppkna2XnK6zecCnm2aalaN6tLHEsJilnF2svLPAx2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-m1lk-tea-from-tiktok.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened To M1lk.tea From TikTok?</span></a>
