On Thursday’s episode of “Grey’s Anatomy,” Dr. Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) makes his first appearance on the show since he was fired in 2007.
The doc is returning as part of the goodbye to original character Dr. Cristina Yang as star Sandra Oh prepares to exit the ABC medical drama at the end of this season.
Burke was Yang’s love interest for the show’s first three seasons, and the two had a tumultuous affair before he jilted her at the altar."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
