The video, which is a little under two minutes, takes fans on a journey to the streets of South Central, Los Angeles, where the “Studio” rapper is seen walking in the middle of the open road with his crew. But like the aforementioned films, a good day never lasts that&nbsp;long.&nbsp;</p><p>The newly leaked music in the video&nbsp;also helps illustrate the trailer as it cuts from Q an his crew playing dice with a couple of friends, to being hounded by cops, and ultimately being locked behind bars.</p><p><strong>READ: <a href=# rel=noopener>Schoolboy Q Shares “Blank Face” LP Cover Art</a></strong></p><p>Directed by Jack Begert & THe Lil Homies, the short video gives listeners a glimpse into what it was like to grow up in Q’s neighborhood. <a href=# id=auto-tag_schoolboy-q_1 data-tag=schoolboy-q>Schoolboy Q</a> continues to build up anticipation surrounding his forthcoming LP, Blank Face.</p><p>The new trailer follows Q’s album art cover, which depicts an image of the infamous Michael Jordan crying meme, which was later trolled on Twitter with a Donald Trump version. In addition to the new music, Q has already released two songs from the album, “Groovy Tony” &nbsp;and “THat Part.”</p><p>Fans will just have to see what else Schoolboy has up his sleeve as his July 8 release date creeps closer.
