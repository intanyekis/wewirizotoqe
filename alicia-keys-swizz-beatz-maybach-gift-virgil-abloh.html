Take a peek below.</p><p>Earlier this month, Swizz Beatz speculated that despite his best efforts, <a class=underline-link href=#>he wasn’t sure if Alicia Keys really did like his thoughtful — and expensive — present</a>.</p><p>During a recent interview with Angie Martinez, the Ruff Ryders ringleader discussed his 12-year marriage to Keys, noting that she tends to be overly kind to him.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>This led Martinez to bring up his Maybach gift and enquire about his wife’s reaction. As Swizz admitted at the time, even though Alicia may not have admitted it, she probably didn’t even like the car.</p><p>“I don’t think she liked the goddamn car,” he said, before Martinez pointed out that the singer did not seem like the “flashy” type either, so perhaps he had a point.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/05/alicia-keys-swizz-beatz-pack-on-pda-on-vacation-in-latin-america-250x142.jpg alt="Alicia Keys & Swizz Beatz Pack On PDA On Vacation In Latin America" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Alicia Keys & Swizz Beatz Pack On PDA On Vacation In Latin America</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>May 20, 2023</p></a><p>While Alicia likes to drive and collects cars, he said the gift was “still at the dealership,” most likely due to reactions on social media to the <a class=underline-link href=#>lavish gifts he has given her in the past</a>.</p><p>He continued: “I know she was already thinking like, ‘Are they gonna be on me if I bring the kids to school in this? Are people gonna know how I’m movin’?’ [I’m sure] she start[ed] thinking like that way with it. She [was just] being very polite.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>The ride, which was unveiled at a car show last December, is a Mercedes-Maybach S-Class S680 model and was designed by Abloh <a class=underline-link href=#>before his November 2021 death</a> in partnership with Gorden Wagener, Mercedes-Benz’s chief design officer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0miYpaGTnq5ut8Syqmarp57Hu3nBnpitsl2irrquwJyfZp%2BZm8FuwsirnqKkXZavrbvH</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./update-seattle-wa-steve-poole-obituary-and-death-cause.html><span>←</span><span>Update Seattle WA Steve Poole Obituary And Death Cause The Talks Today</span></a>
