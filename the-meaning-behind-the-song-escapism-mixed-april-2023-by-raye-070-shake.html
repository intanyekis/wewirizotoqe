RAYE, with her powerful and emotive vocals, expresses her desire to escape the pain of a recent breakup.

The reference to a doctor suggests a desperate cry for help, hoping for a solution to her emotional anguish.</p>[Verse 2: RAYE] Toke this joint how I’m blowin’ this steam<br>Back to my ways like 2019<br>Not twenty-four hours since my ex did dead it<br>I got a new man on me, it’s about to get sweaty<br>Last night really was the cherry on the cake<br>Been some dark days lately, and I’m findin’ it cripplin’<br>Excuse my state, I’m as high as your hopes<br>That you’ll make it to my bed, get me hot and sizzlin’<br>If I take a step back to see the glass half-full<br>At least it’s the Prada two-piece that I’m trippin’ in<br>And I’m already actin’ like a dick, know what I mean?<br>So you might as well stick it in<p>The second verse continues the theme of escapism. The lyrics depict a return to old habits, specifically referencing 2019 and the protagonist’s inclination to replace her ex with a new man. Yet, despite the external facade of confidence, there is an undercurrent of vulnerability. The mention of being as high as someone’s hopes alludes to the longing for validation and the desire to drown out the pain of the past relationship.</p><p>Personal Experiences</p><p>Listening to “Escapism.” (Mixed) [April 2023] resonated with me on a deeply personal level.
