Despite having a new baby at home, the businesswoman clearly has no plans to slow down, given her plans to expand her brand into haircare.</p><p>However, fans have been asking for years when she plans to put out new music. Rihanna’s last album release was Anti in 2016, which went triple platinum. This is the longest RiRi has gone without releasing music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the R&B star has declined to give a date for her next album release, she’s previously said it’s coming sooner than later.</p><p>“ <a href=#>I can’t wait to put something out</a> that I’m really proud of and excited about,” she said of her ninth album in July 2020.</p><p>“It probably is gonna be sooner than my fans think, but I’m just gonna leave that alone because I got enough stress, questions, and, ‘R9, when’s the album coming,” the singer continued. “They don’t leave me alone. I haven’t neglected them. Music is still my baby.”</p><p>She echoed a similar sentiment to <a href=#>Vogue</a> in April, explaining she’s taking her time to perfect her craft. “I'm looking at my next project completely differently from the way I had wanted to put it out before. I think this way suits me better, a lot better," she explained. "It's authentic, it'll be fun for me, and it takes a lot of the pressure off."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Jason Derulo Buys $3.6M Mansion For Ex After Cheating Allegations</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>E!
