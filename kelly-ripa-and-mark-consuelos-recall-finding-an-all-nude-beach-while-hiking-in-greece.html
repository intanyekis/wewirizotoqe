While Consuelos had appeared on the show over the years, it wasn’t until April 17 that he officially took over cohosting duties alongside his wife. (Consuelos and Ripa are also the parents of sons Michael, 26, and Joaquin, 20.)</p><p>“Kelly and I have always [felt] the most [at] ease when we’re together and I feel so lucky we get to do that daily,” he exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly </a>after their first live show together. Ripa, for her part, “had no concerns about how well he was going to do and he really proved me right,” she <a href=#>gushed</a> to Us. “I’m so proud of him, but I was never worried.”</p><p>In fact, the only ones who do need to stress are Ripa and Consuelos’ three adult children — because their parents are known for their on-air sex confessions.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Kelly-Ripa-and-Mark-Consuelos-Recall-Finding-a-Nude-Beach-While-on-a-Hike-in-Greece-393.jpg><p>Of all the <a href=#>All My Children alums</a>‘ candid admissions over the years, one of the most blush-worthy was during a 2019 episode of Live With Kelly and Ryan, when Ripa and Consuelos’ revealed that <a href=#>Lola walked in on them having sex</a> — on her 18th birthday.</p><p>“‘Thanks for ruining my birthday. And thanks for ruining my life. I used to see in color, and now everything is gray!’” Ripa and Consuelos recalled of Lola’s reaction. Though Lola told her parents they were “disgusting” and needed to “chill,” the awkward encounter wasn’t a one-time deal, the ABC personalities shared. After Lola and her parents debriefed Michael and Joaquin on the embarrassing situation, the boys chimed in to share the times they also walked in on their parents getting hot and heavy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaknZyhxm6%2ByKmYZpmemXqurdGkZJynnqjCprjOrGSrnZOWua15xaKlnaGenHqiuoyao6VlnqqxpnnBnpicoF2staq4xGafoqOZo7Rutc1mnqudlZiycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./violent-night-release-date.html><span>←</span><span>David Harbour Starring Violent Night: Release Date, Trailer, Cast, And Everything We Know So Far</span></a>
