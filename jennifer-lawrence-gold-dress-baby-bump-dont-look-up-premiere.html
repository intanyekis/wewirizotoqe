The actress walked the red carpet in a stunning gold dress, which featured a cape that cascaded down her back. The sparkly ensemble put Jennifer’s growing baby bump on display as she attended the star-studded movie premiere.

There is an ensemble cast, which also features&nbsp;<strong>Ariana Grande, Jonah Hill, Meryl Streep, Chris Evans, Cate Blanchett</strong> and more. Filming for the movie was set to begin in April 2020, with a release later that year, but was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/jennifer-lawrence-dont-look-up-premiere-shutterstock-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>This is Jennifer’s first movie since 2019’s&nbsp;Dark Phoenix. While taking a break from her professional career, Jennifer has been focusing on her personal life throughout the past two years. In October 2019, she married&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cooke Maroney</strong></a>, who she had been with for more than a year at the time. Although the two have always been very private about their relationship, they confirmed in September 2021 that they are <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>expecting their first child</a> together.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>When the baby is born, fans can expect Jennifer to keep the little one <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>out of the spotlight</a>, as well. “Every instinct in my body wants to protect their privacy for the rest of our lives, as much as I can,” she admitted in a Nov. 2021 interview. “I don’t want anyone to feel welcome into their existence. And I just feels like that just starts with not including them in this part of my work.” Jennifer and Cooke have yet to confirm whether they are expecting a baby boy or girl.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Despite wanting to keep her baby private, though, Jennifer did add, “If I was at a dinner party and somebody was like, ‘Oh my God, you’re expecting a baby!” I wouldn’t be like, ‘God, I can’t talk about that. Get away from me you psycho!'” The actress’s due date has not been revealed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5ze49vZqOdnqO2p7HRZqOar6Kau6SxjKCmpZxdmb%2Bmv9JmmZqaqWKvtrnPZpuopqRiubC7ymasqWWgp7KutcSrnGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./inside-the-high-risk-world-of-mexicos-cheap-cosmetic-surgery.html><span>←</span><span>Inside the high-risk world of Mexico's cheap cosmetic surgery</span></a>
