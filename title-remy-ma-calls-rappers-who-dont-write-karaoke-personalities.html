You, you are the person that has to write it,” Remy said before labeling those who don’t write as characters. “They’re a great karaoke personality; they’re great at karaoke.

The good ones are really fucking — not even just big words, just the way that they’re able to play with them, and they’re funny. They’re comedians in a way. Those are the things to me that makes you a rapper-rapper.”</p><p>Remy Ma’s comments come shortly after she <a class=underline-link href=#>claimed Doja Cat isn’t an authentic rapper</a> due to her pop-heavy sound. During her appearance on Drink Champs, the Terror Squad MC even corrected co-host N.O.R.E. when he referred to Doja as a rapper.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“I don’t think she’s a rapper,” Remy said. “Let’s be clear with that.
