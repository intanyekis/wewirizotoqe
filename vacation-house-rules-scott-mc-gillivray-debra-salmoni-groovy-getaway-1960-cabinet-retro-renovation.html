However, this time, things were a bit tough as the pair had to renovate the entire 1960s cottage that had been unused for decades. Brother-sister pair John and Don had inherited the cottage from their parents and were quick to reveal that it had been unused since the time their grandparents lived there.</p><p>Hearing this, Scott knew it would be a challenge to give the 1960s cottage dump a dreamy modern retro renovation. Once he stepped into the house, he was shocked to find furniture that was outdated, a lot of memories, and most of all, a LOT of color orange. The shade was overused throughout the house to the point that owners Don and John wondered whose favorite color it had been. To Scott's surprise, the house had a lot of things hidden under the sofa and was being treated as a storage area. Once he stepped into the rooms, he realized that they needed a complete renovation along with the living room and kitchen. He was not happy with how space was used and to add to it, was not too pleased with the use of the same shade yet again.</p><p>However, one thing that made him happy was seeing how the bathroom was renovated. Scott still wanted to make some changes to the bathroom in the hope that it matches the rest of the renovation. Without wasting any time, he was quick to bring out all the furniture along with the cabinets that needed a complete renovation.&nbsp;While Scott and Debra thought that the renovation would be an easy task, they had some hiccups on the way. Right from finding a beehive to the wooden sealing losing its color, Scott knew there were a lot of things they had to workaround. Luckily, he managed to think of ways how things can be worked out and he was happy with the end result.</p><p>Scott and Debra completely transformed the house by bringing in new flooring, cabinets, furniture and others. However, the money-making segment fo the house was the backyard. Scott and Debra made sure that the backyard worked as a social media attraction and allowed renters to feel comfortable and relaxed in the cottage.&nbsp;Once the renovation was done, Scott and Debra invited the brother-sister duo into the house to show the finished project. The duo was shocked and pleased with how everything turned out. Scott was happy to tell them that the house could garner around $350 a night for them. Hearing this, the duo was overjoyed.</p><p>'Vacation House Rules' airs on Saturdays at 8 pm ET on HGTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRorpGYrrW1zqdkoaelqLJuvtSlnKxlo5i8tcCMpppmn5mhuarC0ZqwZpyVl7%2BiedKao6annp56qL7OqK2yZZeawaLDwLJkanFmZXqkrcGipZ6sXaeytb7OZqmepp%2BrrrW1zqc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-marvelous-mrs-maisel-s-4-ep-4-abe-learns-rose-date-asher-cheat-shock-upset-fbi-snitch.html><span>←</span><span>'The Marvelous Mrs Maisel' Season 4 Episode 4: Abe upset Rose had a fling with Asher</span></a>
