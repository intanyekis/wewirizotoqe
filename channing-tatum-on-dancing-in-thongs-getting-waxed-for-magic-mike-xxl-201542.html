In order to look his absolute best for the sequel, in which he reprises his role as a male stripper, he had to have his body waxed to perfection — something he swore he’d never do again after the first Magic Mike movie in 2012.&nbsp;</p><p>Tatum, 34, recounted the painful experience when he stopped by The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Wednesday, Feb. 4, to introduce the <a href=#>titillating Magic Mike XXL trailer</a>, which showcases the Jupiter Ascending actor’s ripped (and yes, hairless) torso.</p><p>“I waxed last time, and I promised myself I was not gonna do it again. And then <strong>Matt Bomer</strong> goes, ‘No, no, you just didn’t have the right lady. She just wasn’t doing it right,'” the star, a real-life former stripper, told DeGeneres. “And then I went again, and it sucked just as bad.”</p><p>Part of the problem, he said, was his hair color. “After they started, they said, ‘Oh, you’re ginger’ — I have a little red in there —&nbsp;and they were like, ‘It’s always the worst for them,'” he recalled. “And I’m like, ‘Then why did you start? Why didn’t you tell me this beforehand?'”</p><p>Tatum’s costar <strong>Stephen “tWitch” Boss</strong>, who’s a DJ on DeGeneres’ show, also got waxed for the film — but he did it on camera, in front of a live studio audience, with DeGeneres holding his hand.</p><p>“It’s bad either way,” the So You Think You Can Dance alum quipped. “I could have been in front of people or not. It would have been just as painful.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Tatum was pretty excited to have tWitch join the cast for the sequel — until he realized they’d have to be nearly naked on-screen together. “I don’t know if you know this, but [tWitch] actually has, like, an exoskeleton,” the actor joked of his costar’s body. “He has a thorax. It’s just like slabs of meat in there.”</p><p>Added DeGeneres: “There are grooves in there that would hold water.”&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The two teased that they have a dance together in the movie — in thongs, according to DeGeneres.</p><p>“Maybe? Yeah, in thongs,” Tatum confirmed. “[There’s] very little left to the imagination.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGacoJGju6q6xmarmqylonqwuoydmKebmaO0brXNZquhp56cwG6zxK2roqaXYsSixMSdZJ%2BnomK6orPInGSmoZuaernEy2ZpaWllaX9w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./basketball-wives-brooke-bailey-speaks-out-about-tragic-time-after-daughter-kayla-death.html><span>←</span><span>Basketball Wives' Brooke Bailey on 'Tragic Time' Since Daughter's Death</span></a>
